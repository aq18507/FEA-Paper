  abstract = {A theoretical model has been developed for predicting the elastic constants of honeycombs based on the deformation of the honeycomb cells by flexure, stretching and hinging. This is an extension of earlier work based on flexure alone. The model has been used to derive expressions for the tensile moduli, shear moduli and Poisson's ratios. Examples are given of structures with a negative Poisson's ratio. It is shown how the properties can be tailored by varying the relative magnitudes of the force constants for the different deformation mechanisms. Off-axis elastic constants are also calculated and it is shown how the moduli and Poisson's ratios vary with applied loading direction. Depending on the geometry of the honeycomb the properties may be isotropic (for regular hexagons) or extremely anisotropic. Again, the degree of anisotropy is also affected by the relative magnitude of the force constants for the three deformation mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The equivalent in-plane elastic and shear moduli of the structure are studied through a combination of theoretical and finite element analysis. Then the maximum global strains are investigated to show the morphing capability of the structure. Results show that the in-plane moduli of the cellular structures are several orders of magnitude lower than the raw material. The global strains of the cellular structures could be over 10 times greater than the raw material. The results also demonstrate the potential of the proposed structure for uniaxial, shear or hybrid in-plane morphing.},

The in-plane behavior of the honeycomb has also been investigated against the geometrical parameters of the unit cell using a parametrical analysis.

  abstract  = {This study deals with the problem of the least-weight design of a lattice structure subject to constraints of different nature. To face this problem, a general multi-scale optimisation procedure is proposed. This approach aims at optimising both global and local geometric parameters defining the shape of the representative volume element of the lattice at the mesoscopic scale. The optimisation procedure involves design requirements defined at different scales: geometric and manufacturing constraints are involved at the mesoscopic scale, whilst thermodynamic constraints on the positive definiteness of the stiffness tensor of the lattice (modelled as an equivalent homogeneous anisotropic medium) intervene at the macroscopic scale. Finally, since lattice structures usually undergo compressive loads, a requirement on the first local buckling load is considered too. The proposed approach is based on (a) the non-uniform rational basis splines curves theory to describe the shape of the struts composing the lattice, (b) the strain energy homogenisation technique of periodic media to perform the scale transition and (c) a special genetic algorithm to perform optimisation calculations. The optimised solutions provided by the presented method are characterised by a weight saving of about 39 {\%} with slightly enhanced mechanical properties when compared to conventional octahedral lattice structures.},

We present a novel approach to generate optimised functionally graded lattice core structures. Firstly, topology optimisation is performed to return the optimal core density distribution to minimise the structure's compliance subject to a mass constraint. A series of isostatic lines are then constructed with respect to the local principal stresses to generate a lattice structure spatially graded with respect to lattice cell size, aspect ratio and orientation. To validate this novel approach, optimisation is performed on a sandwich core structure subject to three point bending. Experimental tests confirm the greatly improved stiffness and strength properties (101{\%} and 172{\%} respectively) of the core as a result of spatially grading the lattice cells when compared to a benchmark core with uniform cell size of the same density. The new approach also significantly outperforms lattice structures with graded diameters as optimised by state-of-the-art commercial software packages. Non-dimensional core performance indices are formulated to express the relative specific stiffness and strength properties of the core for the three design approaches.},

  abstract = {The Spanwise Morphing Trailing Edge (SMTE) concept seeks to improve aerodynamic performance for small UAVs by creating a smooth control surface that can achieve complex spanwise variation in camber while eliminating gaps and discontinuities. This work represents the first force and deformation analysis of a morphing wing with a smooth surface and independent spanwise-varying actuation for this scale of aircraft. The SMTE concept was realized via a modular design consisting of twelve alternating active and passive spanwise sections. Each active section consisted of a flexure box aileron, actuated by bending Macro-Fiber Composites, with an embedded flex sensor used for closed-loop positional control. Each passive section was composed of an elastomeric honeycomb skin, reducing bubbling and buckling due to aerodynamic loads while still allowing differential actuation between the active sections. The performance of the SMTE concept was measured on a half-span finite wing of 0.3 meter chord, aspect ratio 6 in a wind tunnel. A six axis load balance measured forces about the root quarter-chord and a motion capture system provided tracking of trailing edge deflections. A reference wing consisting of six servo-driven flaps was also tested for a comparison of the SMTE concept against conventional flap technology. Several uniform and differential actuations were investigated for both wings at different angles of attacked, representing attached and separating flow. The SMTE concept achieved tip displacements of approximately 25{\%} of the servo-driven wing, but achieved comparable change in lift for less drag. When normalized by tip deflections measured by the displacements to obtain control derivatives, the SMTE showed actuation effectiveness of three to five times that of the flapped configuration. Additionally, the SMTE eliminated inboard flap vortices maintaining control derivatives improving control derivative performance, and motivating further studies of the concept at other flow speeds and actuation conditions.},

The mechanical properties of FDM and injection molded parts were studied under several environmental conditions. Design/methodology/approach - FDM components can be used as load-carrying elements under a range of moisture and temperature conditions. FDM parts show anisotropic mechanical properties according to build orientation. Components were fabricated from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene in three different orientations. The mechanical properties of parts fabricated by FDM were compared to injection molded components made from the same material. Water absorption tests were conducted in distilled water between 20 and 60°C to identify the maximum water absorption rate. Both moisture and temperature were considered as environmental variables in the tensile tests, which were conducted under various conditions to measure the effects on mechanical properties. Findings - The water absorption behavior of FDM components obeyed Fickian diffusion theory, irrespective of the temperature. High temperatures accelerated the diffusion rate, although the maximum water absorption rate was not affected. The tensile strength of FDM parts under dry, room temperature conditions, was approximately 26-56 per cent that of injection molded parts, depending on build orientation. Increased temperature and water absorption had a more significant effect on FDM parts than injection molded components. The tensile strength was decreased by 67-71 per cent in hot, wet environments compared with dry, room temperature conditions. Originality/value - The water absorption behavior of FDM components was investigated. The quantitative effects of temperature and moisture on tensile strength, modulus and strain were also measured. These results will contribute to the design of FDM parts for use under various environmental conditions.},

The filament was exposed to humidity conditions to achieve various moisture concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.16, 0.4 and 0.8 wt.{\%}) and corresponding printed parts were evaluated for mechanical performance using tensile test dogbones. The rate of transport was modeled by Fickian diffusion and diffusion coefficients were obtained for various exposure conditions. Moduli, strain to failure and ultimate strength were evaluated in the XY (flat horizontal) and ZX(vertical) direction relative to the build plate orientation. Image analyses of cross-sections as well as their corresponding fracture surfaces were evaluated for consolidation, porosity distribution and failure behavior. Mechanical test data showed a significant decrease in tensile strength ({\textgreater}60{\%}) and failure strain ({\textgreater}50{\%}) over the range of filament moisture levels investigated. A decrease in failure strain of 41{\%} was observed with moisture levels as low as 0.16{\%}. This degradation was especially sensitive in parts printed in the vertical direction, which resulted in an ultimate failure strain of only 1{\%}. The changes in mechanical performance are believed to be due to a combination of entrapped volatiles resulting in increased porosity at higher moisture levels as well as moisture induced pseudo-crosslinking at lower concentrations. Optical micrographs showed that specimens with 0.16{\%} moisture or greater were filled with observable porosity and increased surface roughness. The rheological behavior of extruded material indicated plasticization as evidenced by melt flow index measurements and changes in the flow characteristics of moisture-exposed extrudate. DMA data show a distinct decrease in Tg with increased moisture content, which is consistent with plasticization. The absorption characteristics at room temperature lab conditions indicate that the material will reach an unacceptable level within one hour of room-temperature exposure.

  abstract = {Compliant structures, such as flexible corrugated panels and honeycomb structures, are promising structural solutions for morphing aircraft. The compliant structure can be tailored to carry aerodynamic loads and achieve the geometry change simultaneously, while the reliability of the morphing aircraft can be guaranteed if conventional components and materials are used. In this paper, a compliant structure is proposed to change the dihedral angle of a morphing winglet. Unsymmetrical stiffness is introduced in the compliant structure to induce the rotation of the structure when it is actuated. Trapezoidal corrugated panels are used in the compliant structure, whose geometry parameters can be tailored to provide the stiffness asymmetry. An equivalent model of the corrugated panel is employed to calculate the deformation of the compliant structure, which improves the efficiency of the optimization. The optimization is performed to determine the optimum geometry variables, while also considering the actuator requirements and the available space to install the compliant structure. To provide the airfoil shape a flexible honeycomb structure is integrated into the morphing skin panel. The stiffness of the honeycomb structure can be designed to be much smaller than the stiffness of the corrugated panel, which ensures the deformation of the corrugated panel will not be influenced significantly by the honeycomb structure, and the deflections of the morphing winglet can still be calculated preliminarily by the simplified model. An experimental prototype has been manufactured to demonstrate the deformation of the morphing winglet, and a detailed finite element analysis has further verified the morphing winglet model.},

  abstract = {Honeycombs resemble the structure of a number of natural and biological materials such as cancellous bone, wood, and cork. Thick honeycomb could be also used for energy absorption applications. Moreover, studying the mechanical behavior of honeycombs under in-plane loading could help understanding the mechanical behavior of more complex 3D tessellated structures such as porous biomaterials. In this paper, we study the mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs made using additive manufacturing techniques that allow for fabrication of honeycombs with arbitrary and precisely controlled thickness. Thick honeycombs with different wall thicknesses were produced from polylactic acid (PLA) using fused deposition modelling, i.e., an additive manufacturing technique. The samples were mechanically tested in-plane under compression to determine their mechanical properties. We also obtained exact analytical solutions for the stiffness matrix of thick hexagonal honeycombs using both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The stiffness matrix was then used to derive analytical relationships that describe the elastic modulus, yield stress, and Poisson's ratio of thick honeycombs. Finite element models were also built for computational analysis of the mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs under compression. The mechanical properties obtained using our analytical relationships were compared with experimental observations and computational results as well as with analytical solutions available in the literature. It was found that the analytical solutions presented here are in good agreement with experimental and computational results even for very thick honeycombs, whereas the analytical solutions available in the literature show a large deviation from experimental observation, computational results, and our analytical solutions.},

  abstract = {The seed capsule of Delosperma nakurense is a remarkable example of a natural hygromorph, which unfolds its protecting valves upon wetting to expose its seeds. The beautiful mechanism responsible for this motion is generated by a specialized organ based on an anisotropic cellular tissue filled with a highly swelling material. Inspired by this system, we study the mechanics of a diamond honeycomb internally pressurized by a fluid phase. Numerical homogenization by means of iterative finite-element (FE) simulations is adapted to the case of cellular materials filled with a variable pressure fluid phase. Like its biological counterpart, it is shown that the material architecture controls and guides the otherwise unspecific isotropic expansion of the fluid. Deformations up to twice the original dimensions can be achieved by simply setting the value of input pressure. In turn, these deformations cause a marked change of the honeycomb geometry and hence promote a stiffening of the material along the weak direction. To understand the mechanism further, we also developed a micromechanical model based on the Born model for crystal elasticity to find an explicit relation between honeycomb geometry, swelling eigenstrains and elastic properties. The micromechanical model is in good qualitative agreement with the FE simulations. Moreover, we also provide the force-stroke characteristics of a soft actuator based on the pressurized anisotropic honeycomb and show how the internal pressure has a nonlinear effect which can result in negative values of the in-plane Poisson's ratio. As nature shows in the case of the D. nakurense seed capsule, cellular materials can be used not only as low-weight structural materials, but also as simple but convenient actuating materials. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract  = {Adaptive aerostructures offer the potential of increasing both aerodynamic and structural efficiency compared to conventional aerospace technologies. However, there is frequently an awkward trade-off between designing for large deformations whilst being able to withstand external loads. Multistable laminates which derive their multistability via thermal expansion mismatches are of interest for adaptive structures due to their ability to demonstrate relatively high stiffness in multiple stable states whilst being able to undergo large deformations with reduced stiffness. In addition, actuators only need to work during transition between stable shapes. However, many practical problems have arisen with the application of these laminates when designing adaptive structures. Such problems include hygrothermal variability, a limited design space with regards to achievable shape change, and insufficient stiffness for many applications. Prestressing technologies offer solutions to all of these problems. This paper summarises recent developments concerning the various means by which prestress can be used for stiffness tailoring in adaptive structures. Example prestressed structures are given including camber and twist change morphing airfoils. The use of prestress for stiffness tailoring in the design of novel passive vibration isolators and adaptive air intakes is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

  abstract  = {Continuous carbon fibre composite additive manufacturing opens up new possibilities for automated, cost-effective manufacturing of highly-loaded structures. This is achieved by the high design freedom of the process, allowing to tailor the fibre placement and by thereby fully exploiting the anisotropy and strength of the composite material. On the other hand, compliant or so-called morphing mechanisms - exploiting the elastic properties of the material to achieve shape changes - show great potential in improving the flight performance of aerospace structures. Such structures exhibit complex internal topologies, making them prohibitively expensive to manufacture with conventional processes. Combining additive manufacturing of composites with the utilization of morphing mechanisms has the potential to concurrently reduce manufacturing cost whilst greatly improving the flight performance of aerospace structures. The applicability of composite additive manufacturing to morphing aerospace structures is discussed in this letter. For the first time, the complete composite primary- and morphing-structure of a fixed-wing drone is additively manufactured. The drone is successfully flight-tested, evaluating the potential of combining these two emerging technologies.},

In this paper, a polyurethane adhesive is considered as an exemplary material and subjected to tensile, compressive and shear tests. Conventional hyperelastic models are unable to capture the mechanical behavior satisfyingly: If the model agrees with the test results at large strains, it underestimates the stiffness at low strains significantly. We propose a model extension to describe a kind of exponential decay of stiffness which bears some similarity with a specific model developed by Yeoh. The new hyperelastic model is coupled with linear viscoelasticity to account for the strain rate dependence observed for the tested material. The model parameters are identified using a tensile test at a single strain rate only and a creep test. Furthermore, the compressibility is determined by comparison of the stiffness in two butt joint tests with different aspect rations of the adhesive layer. Using this parameter set the new model provides a very good prediction of tensile, compressive and shear tests at different strain rates.},

  abstract  = {Constitutive models for hyperelastic materials, such as rubber, foams and certain biological tissues, are usually defined in terms of several constants. By means of a non-linear curve fitting procedure, stress-strain test data can be used to evaluate those constants for a given model. Routines devoted to this task exist on all major finite element software packages. Nevertheless, in most cases the user has little or no control over the curve fitting process and cannot define the optimization parameters used by the software. Furthermore, those functionalities are often restricted to few pre-selected hyperelastic models and there is no direct way of comparing the results yielded by different modeling choices. Selecting the model that best fits a particular test curve can be a challenge. HyperFit is a research code developed to help minimizing these difficulties. Non-linear least squares methods are applied to match theoretical curves with user provided experimental data, resulting in optimized material constants. The code allows multi-criteria optimization, so that the analyst can optimize the constants against more than one type of experimental data. In addition, an interface was developed to simplify the calibration and comparison of several different hyperelastic models, easing the task of selecting the best model for a given set of experimental data. An example of application and usage is presented and discussed.},

The experiment data from Treloar (1944) was fitted very well, and the determined parameters by using this method were proven correct and practical in the numerical verification in ANSYS. Then, the constitutive model of the hyper-viscoelastic materials combining the Ogden model with the generalized Maxwell model was explained in detail, and the parameter identification method was also proposed by using the pattern search method. Then, three groups of relaxation tests of uniaxial tension and four groups of simple shear tests with different loading velocities were conducted to obtain the corresponding virtual experiment data. After discussing the constraints and initial setting values for the undetermined parameters, these virtual data of different loading histories were respectively employed to identify the parameters in the hyper-elastic model, and the accuracy and the reliability of the estimated parameters were also verified in ANSYS.},

  abstract = {For efficient screening of phage antibody libraries obtained by selection on whole cells, we have developed a modified colony lift assay using cell-coated filters. Both cells growing in suspension as well as adherent cells can be coated onto nitrocellulose filters and used to detect bacterial colonies responsible for the production of cell-binding (specific) single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies. We demonstrate, using a selected library developed in our laboratory (named "AB" library) as a model system, that the frequency of specific clones as detected by colony lift assay using cell-coated filter is comparable to the frequency of positive clones as detected by the "classical" method (i.e. random picking and flow cytometric analysis). However, the colony lift assay enables detection and isolation of a higher number of specific clones as compared to the random pick. This is due to screening of a much higher number of clones simultaneously (it is possible to screen at least 1000 clones plated on one 9-cm agar dish). Using this method, clones occurring at a low frequency (such as present in early selection rounds) can be detected and isolated efficiently. We clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the colony lift assay with cell-coated filter by applying it to screen the head-and-neck carcinoma (HN) library (a selected library generated in our laboratory). Using the assay, but not the random picking, we were able to isolate specific clones from 2nd to 3rd selection rounds of the HN library. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {A great variety of models can describe the nonlinear response of rubber to uniaxial tension. Yet an indepth understanding of the successive stages of large extension is still lacking. We show that the response can be broken down in three steps, which we delineate by relying on a simple formatting of the data, the so-called Mooney plot transform. First, the small-to-moderate regime, where the polymeric chains unfold easily and the Mooney plot is almost linear. Second, the strain-hardening regime, where blobs of bundled chains unfold to stiffen the response in correspondence to the 'upturn' of the Mooney plot. Third, the limiting-chain regime, with a sharp stiffening occurring as the chains extend towards their limit. We provide strain-energy functions with terms accounting for each stage that (i) give an accurate local and then global fitting of the data. (ii) are consistent with weak nonlinear elasticity theory and (iii) can be interpreted in the framework of statistical mechanics. We apply our method to Treloar's classical experimental data and also to some more recent data. Our method not only provides models that describe the experimental data with a very low quantitative relative error, but also shows that the theory of nonlinear elasticity is much more robust that seemed at first sight.},

Once the desired hyperelastic model has its parameters fitted to the available experimental results, these hyperelastic parameters have to fulfill the requirements imposed by the Baker-Ericksen inequalities in order to guarantee a plausible physical behavior to the material, although seldom used. When applied to an incompressible isotropic hyperelastic model, these inequalities state that the first derivative of the strain energy density function with respect to the first strain invariant must be positive and the first derivative of the strain energy density function with respect to the second strain invariant must be non-negative. The aim of this work is to study which improvements the requirement of the Baker-Ericksen inequalities can bring when fitting hyperelastic models to experimental data. This is accomplished through a constrained optimization procedure. Results obtained for natural rubber and silicon samples considering classical and newly developed hyperelastic models are shown and discussed.},

It is likely that thermoplastic composite components will enter RAAF service in the near future in the form of replacement components which were previously manufactured from metals or thermosetting composites such as graphite/epoxy. Thermoplastic resins offer a number of advantages over conventional thermosetting resins such as epoxies. Thermoplastics exhibit chemical and impact resistance and may be used over a wide range of temperatures. They have a very low level of moisture uptake which means their mechanical properties are less degraded under hot/wet conditions. Thermoplastic composite materials offer a number of advantages but may also require different manufacturing and repair techniques. In particular it is often necessary to use significantly higher processing temperatures and pressures than for typical thermosetting composite materials. In general, thermoplastic composites are currently more difficult to repair than conventional thermosetting composites. Given the range of possible structural forms and types of damage, it is likely that a range of different repair techniques will be necessary with no single method being optimum for all cases.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia.

Uniaxial tension tests are performed to identify the material properties, specifically the Young's modulus, the maximum stretch, the tensile strength and the material's fracture toughness. The influence of geometric characteristics on the material properties is studied. From the experimental results the parameters of Ogden's hyperelastic material model are derived. A finite element simulation of the uniaxial tensile test validates the values obtained from a conditional least-square fit. In conclusion, additional to the experimentally determined rupture properties, the elastic parameters adapted to a Neo-Hookean, a Money-Rivlin and an Ogden material model of Ninjaflex are presented.},

To better understand the mechanical response of these materials—due to potential integration of FDM parts into structural components—compact tension samples of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) were printed in three orthogonal orientations to analyze how the fracture toughness varied with mesostructure. Furthermore, in each of these orientations the raster pattern was either an alternating +45/−45° or a 0/90° pattern. When the alignment of extruded filament layers changed from parallel to perpendicular with respect to the crack plane, a 54{\%} increase in fracture toughness was observed. However, the raster pattern only had a significant effect in one of the print orientations. the fracture toughness decreased by 11{\%} when a 0/90° pattern was used in place of a +45/−45° pattern in layers oriented perpendicularly to the crack plane. The orientation of individual tracks of deposited material with respect to the crack tip appeared to have the most pronounced role in altering the fracture toughness of FDM ABS.

Thermoplastic polyurethanes are copolymers composed of hard and soft segments. The hard and soft segments phase separate to form a microstructure of hard and soft domains typically on a length scale of a few tens of nanometers. Studies have revealed this domain structure to evolve with deformation. this evolution is thought to be the primary source of hysteresis and cyclic softening. In this paper, experiments and a constitutive model capturing the major features of the stress-strain behavior of TPUs, including nonlinear hyperelastic behavior, time dependence, hysteresis, and softening, are presented. The model is based on the morphological observations of TPUs during deformation. A systematic method to estimate the material parameters for the model is presented. Excellent agreement between experimental results and model predictions of various uniaxial compression tests confirms the efficacy of the proposed constitutive model.},

The in-plane characteristics of the cosine honeycomb are compared with accordion honeycomb through analytical models and experiments. Finally, the application of the cosine honeycomb on a variable camber wing is studied. Studies show that mechanical model agrees well with results of FEM and experiments. The transverse non-dimensional elastic modulus of the cosine honeycomb increases (decreases) when the wavelength or the wall width increases (decreases), or when the amplitude decreases (increases). Compared with accordion honeycomb, the transverse non-dimensional elastic modulus of the cosine honeycomb is smaller, which means the driving force is smaller and the power consumption is less during deformation. In addition, the cosine honeycomb can satisfy the deforming requirements of the variable camber wing. {\textcopyright} 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA {\&} BUAA.},

The results show the existence of large variations in linear elastic constants and degree of anisotropy, which can be achieved by changing the lattice geometry parameters.

  abstract  = {Morphing aircraft wings require flexible skins that can undergo large strains, have low in-plane stiffness and very high out-of-plane flexural bending stiffness. The large strain capability is especially important for gross morphing applications such as span change where the skins may be required to undergo axial strains of the order of 50{\%} or greater. Low in-plane stiffness allows morphing to be accomplished at a reasonable energy cost while high bending stiffness ensures that skin sections between supports do not suffer from significant out-of-plane deformation under aerodynamic pressure loads. One solution proposed is to use sandwiched skins with flexible face-sheets and cellular cores. The cellular cores can be designed to be high-strain capable, have low axial stiffness and high bending stiffness. For some morphing applications (for example, wing span change or chord or camber change), the required deformation is mostly one-dimensional. In such a case, cellular cores with zero Poisson's ratios, which do not display contraction (or bulge) perpendicular to the morphing direction are desired. Restraining the Poisson's contraction (or bulge) of a "conventional" cellular honeycomb results in the effective axial stiffness in the morphing direction increasing by over an order of magnitude. This paper proposes "hybrid" and "accordion" cellular honeycombs, where regular cells (with positive cell angle) and auxetic cells (with negative cell angle) are combined so as to provide large strain capability in one direction (the morphing direction) together with zero Poisson's ratio. Cellular material theory is extended to allow for the analysis of such hybrid and accordion cellular honeycombs, and the results are validated using the Finite Element code ANSYS. Thereafter, the properties and behavior of the hybrid and accordion zero Poisson's ratio cellular honeycombs are thoroughly examined vis-{\`{a}}-vis conventional cellular honeycombs which have single cell-type.},

  abstract = {The use of regular hexagonal honeycombs is widely spread into composites area, in special for sandwich structures, due to their low density and good in-plane and out-planes mechanical properties. For conventional applications, e.g. plates and flat components, hexagonal honeycomb present excellent results. However, when double curvature is required this type of cellular material most of time leads to poor solutions. This problem is due, in part, to the Poisson effect. When the honeycomb is bent in one direction a deformation on the transverse direction is induced. Moreover, this deformation has an opposite sign of the one generated into the bending direction. Due to this problem a different design for honeycombs is needed. The new design proposed is unique in the sense that the in-plane Poisson's ratio in both directions is equal to -1. With a negative Poisson's ratio the deformation on transverse direction is forced to have the same signal that one created during the bending. By doing it, it is possible to defeat the double curvature problems and generated the final sandwich structure. The mathematical formulation for computing the honeycomb elastic moduli is also presented. So far, the results are encouraging and the experimental analysis is under development.},

Springs and snubbers, seals and gaskets, hose and belting, friction drives and roll covers - a comprehensive listing of essential rubber components would be surprisingly long. And yet, in spite of this widespread and necessary use of rubber in engineering, a general working knowledge of rubber science and technology is rather uncommon. Because they have little information or experience to guide them, design engineers tend to treat rubber as a suspicious and unreliable material, to be avoided if possible. But in many cases, use of a rubber part gives a simple and elegant solution to a major engineering problem. Recent examples are rubber bearings for road bridges, allowing for thermal expansion of the bridge deck without putting excessive loads on the bridge supports. rubber springs transmitting power to helicopter blades and simultaneously providing specified (and different) stiffnesses in various directions, to permit changing inclination of the blades, and rubber supports for buildings, to protect the structure against subsurface movements in earthquakes.},

This particular ZPR configuration allows achieving large out-of-plane deformations and tailored in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical properties. We present a series of analytical models, finite element simulations and experimental tests to evaluate the bending capability of these cellular structures. A comparison of the out-of-plane bending behavior of six different types of cellular topologies with the same relative density of the ZPR honeycomb has also been carried out by using three-point bending tests. Further parametric analyses have also been performed to determine the dependence of the equivalent bending modulus versus the geometric parameters that define the ZPR honeycomb. The novel ZPR lattices show the highest bending compliance at large strains, and highly tailorable mechanical properties for the design of composite structures for airframe morphing applications.},

Uniaxial experiments were performed in order to characterize the constitutive behaviour of the rubber material in terms of several constitutive models available in the literature. These constitutive models were used to develop computational estimates for the quasi-static load-displacement response of a rigid spherical indentor that deflects the rubber membrane in a controlled fashion and to determine the deflected shape of the membrane at specified load levels. Both axisymmetric and asymmetric deflections of the rubber membrane were investigated. The paper provides a comparison of the experimental results for the membrane deflections with results derived from computational simulations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The existing nonlinear models for circular membranes and thin plates are reviewed. It is desirable to have analytical or approximate analytical models for the nonlinear deflections, strains, and stresses of membranes because of their maneuverable and insightful forms albeit the available numerical solutions. The new nonlinear models for prestretched and post-heated circular membranes under uniform pressure by both the Ritz method and the Galerkin method have been derived. The new nonlinear membrane model has been validated and compared to other related existing models. Furthermore, the condition of the pre-tensioned stress to minimize the maximum equivalent stress of membranes has been obtained. The solutions for thin plates have also been extended to include pretension and post-heating. The truncation error of the stretching factor of thin plates is corrected. For circular membranes and thin plates, both the Ritz method and the Galerkin method give the same answer if both the radial and axial displacements derived from the Galerkin method are used. The computer software MATLAB has also been used to verify the derivations of new membrane and thin plate models.},

The minimum detectable deflection, using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, is about 0.02 nm for dynamic measurements (A-weighted filtering). The largest measurable deflection (where nonlinearities of the interferometer are negligible) is strongly influenced by the wavelength of the laser and is about 10 nm. Thus, applying this method to pressure sensors and gas flow meters, the pressure range is restricted. In order to achieve a high sensitivity of the measuring apparatus and a low detectable deflection amplitude a feedback configuration stabilizes the interferometer in the most sensitive operation points. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Under a negative air pressure differential, these membranes can deform or balloon. Ballooning of the membrane will affect many aspects of performance. For instance, it will change the volume of the air chamber in screen-type wall systems and will, therefore, affect both the extent of screen pressure moderation and the nature of ventilation within the wall. This paper develops the structural mechanics for flexible membranes ballooning in two dimensions under an air pressure differential. The governing differential equation is derived and solved numerically. A second-order parabola is assumed to describe the ballooning shape of the two-dimensional flexible membrane. Alternative theories for the ballooning shape are reviewed and compared. A series of physical tests were carried out to confirm the deformed shape and the magnitude of the peak deflection. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

  abstract  = {Heterogeneous materials with tailored, site-specific physical properties, ubiquitously found in biological systems, can reach optimal performances in applications. Compared to homogeneous materials or composite materials with random, disordered microstructures, materials with locally addressable properties achieve higher strength at lower density, or record-high shock absorption properties. A classic example of tailored, heterogeneous materials are functionally graded materials or materials where stiffness variations in bulk are controllable. However, current methods to locally control stiffness in a solid are mostly limited to geometrical variation of architected micro-structures, or to the creation of multi-material composites. Here, a novel approach to program stiffness variations within a single material system is presented. By subsequent exposure of a pre-crosslinked polymeric matrix using two-photon polymerization, arbitrary three-dimensional architectures with locally addressable stiffness variations are fabricated. Furthermore, the extension of the hierarchical level of three-dimensional micro-architectures by property variations in the constituent material is demonstrated. The programmable stiffness variations, in the sub-micron range, are either continuous or sharply confined, with a stiffness increase of up to 200{\%} compared to the pre-crosslinked matrix. This site-specific control of stiffness and internal architecture opens the door for engineering materials with unprecedented mechanical properties.},

As a result, one can print models that are not limited to aesthetics purposes but can now also provide larger functionality, and therefore with mechanical performance tuned according to their purpose. With this in mind, this paper addresses the mechanical performance of multi-material printed objects, specially focused on the interface zone generated between the different materials at their geometrical boundaries. Tensile test specimens were designed and printed in three types: (A) a single-material specimen printed by a single extrusion head (B) a single-material but multi-section specimen printed in a zebra-crossing structure by two extrusion heads, and (C) a multi-material specimen printed with two materials in a zebra-crossing pattern. The materials considered were PLA, TPU and PET. The comparison of the mechanical performance between Type-A and -B specimens demonstrated the negative influence of the presence of a geometrical boundary interface between the same material. On the other hand, the comparison between Type-B and -C demonstrated how the previous performance loss was yet more drastic when the lack of chemical affinity between the materials was present. The methodology proposed to assess the quality of the pairs of materials selected is innovative, and enabled to depict the importance of the boundary design in multi-material printing techniques.},

The integration of increasingly innovative technologies, such as reliable kinematic mechanisms, embedded servo-actuation and smart materials systems, enables us to realize new structural systems fully compatible with the more and more stringent airworthiness requirements. In this paper, the authors describe the characterization of an adaptive structure, representative of a wing trailing edge, consisting of a finger-like rib mechanism with a highly deformable skin, which comprises both soft and stiff parts. The morphing skin is able to follow the trailing edge movement under repeated cycles, while being stiff enough to preserve its shape under aerodynamic loads and adequately pliable to minimize the actuation power required for morphing. In order to properly characterize the system, a mock-up was manufactured whose structural properties, in particular the ability to carry out loads, were also guaranteed by the elastic skin. A numerical sensitivity analysis with respect to the mechanical properties of the multi-segment skin was performed to investigate their influence on the modal response of the whole system. Experimental dynamic tests were then carried out and the obtained results were critically analysed to prove the adequacy of the adopted design approaches as well as to quantify the dissipative (high-damping) effects induced by the rubber foam on the dynamic response of the morphing architecture.},

Using numerical homogenization, our method summarizes the macro-mechanical behavior of these tilings in terms of direction-dependent Young's modulus (shown above), Poisson's ratio, and bending stiffness as well as a simple measure of nonlinearity. We propose a comprehensive approach to characterizing the mechanical properties of structured sheet materials, i.e., planar rod networks whose mechanics and aesthetics are inextricably linked. We establish a connection between the complex mesoscopic deformation behavior of such structures and their macroscopic elastic properties through numerical homogenization. Our approach leverages 3D Kirchhoff rod simulation in order to capture nonlinear effects for both in-plane and bending deformations. We apply our method to different families of structures based on isohedral tilings-a simple yet extensive and aesthetically interesting group of space-filling patterns. We show that these tilings admit a wide range of material properties , and our homogenization approach allows us to create concise and intuitive descriptions of a material's direction-dependent macromechanical behavior that are easy to communicate even to non-experts. We perform this characterization for an extensive set of structures and organize these data in a material browser to enable efficient forward exploration of the aesthetic-mechanical space of structured sheet materials. We also propose an inverse design method to automatically find structure parameters that best approximate a user-specified target behavior.},

These materials are typically synthesized polyester foams with a very heterogeneous structure, but the role of disorder in auxetic behavior is not fully understood. Here, we provide a systematic theoretical and experimental investigation in to the effect of disorder on the mechanical properties of a paradigmatic auxetic lattice with a re-entrant hexagonal geometry. We show that disorder has a marginal effect on the Poisson's ratio unless the lattice topology is altered, and in all cases examined the disorder preserves the auxetic characteristics. Depending on the direction of loading applied to these disordered auxetic lattices, either brittle or ductile failure is observed. It is found that brittle failure is associated with a disorder-dependent tensile strength, whereas in ductile failure disorder does not affect strength. Our work thus provides general guidelines to optimize elasticity and strength of disordered auxetic metamaterials.},

  abstract = {The term ‘morphing aircraft' describes a broad range of air vehicles and vehicle components that adapt to planned and unplanned multipoint mission requirements. Adaptation or morphing requires changing system features including vehicle ‘states,' such as vehicle shape, during in-flight operation. The term morphing can be applied to almost any activity in which in-flight vehicle features are changed. As such, morphing has become a buzzword loosely applied to a wide variety of activities, some of which are disconnected from air vehicle morphing development. This has led to three myths: 1) morphing shape change is too expensive, 2) morphing aircraft must weigh more than nonmorphing aircraft, and 3) morphing requires exotic materials and complex systems. This paper attempts to dispel these myths by reviewing early morphing aircraft history to identify inventions and innovations that led to both successes and failures. The review also discusses recent government-sponsored activities in the United States: in particular, morphing systems development sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency viewed from the author's perspective as a former Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Program Manager. The review concludes with identification of possible avenues for future morphing aircraft evolution and morphing device development.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the manufacturing, characterization and parametric modeling of a novel fiber-reinforced composite flexible skin with in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behavior. The elastic mechanical performance of the auxetic skin is evaluated using a three-dimensional analytical model based on the classical laminate theory (CLT) and Sun's thick laminate theory. Good agreement is observed between in-plane Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli of the composite skin obtained by the theoretical model and the experimental results. A parametric analysis carried out with the validated model shows that significant changes in the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio can be achieved through different combinations of matrix and fiber materials and stacking sequences. It is also possible to identify fiber-reinforced composite skin configurations with the same in-plane auxeticity but different orthotropic stiffness performance, or the same orthotropic stiffness performance but different in-plane auxeticity. The analysis presented in this work provides useful guidelines to develop and manufacture flexible skins with negative Poisson's ratio for applications focused on morphing aircraft wing designs.},

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. We present a hybrid pneumatic/flexible sandwich structure with thermoplastic (TP) nanocomposite skins to enable the morphing of a nacelle inlet lip. The design consists of pneumatic inflatables as actuators and a flexible sandwich panel that morphs under variable pressure combinations to adapt different flight conditions and save fuel. The sandwich panel forms the outer layer of the nacelle inlet lip. It is lightweight, compliant and impact resistant with no discontinuities, and consists of graphene-doped thermoplastic polyurethane (G/TPU) skins that are supported by an aluminium Flex-core honeycomb in the middle, with near zero in-plane Poisson's ratio behaviour. A test rig for a reduced-scale demonstrator was designed and built to test the prototype of morphing nacelle with custom-made pneumatic actuators. The output force and the deflections of the experimental demonstrator are verified with the internal pressures of the actuators varying from 0 to 0.41 MPa. The results show the feasibility and promise of the hybrid inflatable/nanocomposite sandwich panel for morphing nacelle airframes.},

There has been a pressing need for morphing wing skin structures that hold both low in-plane and high out-of-plane stiffness. A design methodology for the gripper pin morphing wing skin is presented here. The torsional and bending resistance mechanisms of the wing skin are presented to demonstrate its performance. The performance of the gripper pin wing skin under the variable camber compliant wing morphing process was estimated using 3D finite element models. According to the 3D finite element analyses, the stress levels of the gripper pin skin are much lower than that of the bulk material skin. The gripper pin wing skin structure has an enormous advantage with regard to the stress level and given its low actuation energy.

There has so far been only limited research on the fatigue behavior of 3D printed polymers to determine which printing or material parameters result in the most favorable fatigue behavior. To better understand the effects of the printing technique, printing materials, and printing parameters on the fatigue behavior of 3D printed materials, we present here an overview of the data currently available in the literature including fatigue testing protocols and a quantitative analysis of the available fatigue data per type of the AM technology. The results of our literature review clearly show that, due to the synergism between printing parameters and the properties of the printed material, it is challenging to determine the best combination of variables for fatigue resistance. There is therefore a need for more experimental and computational fatigue studies to understand how the above-mentioned material and printing parameters affect the fatigue behavior.},

One of the most promising aspects of AM is the possibility to create highly complex geometries. Despite a growing body of knowledge concerning the technological challenges, there is a lack of methods that allow designers to effectively deal with the new possibilities. This article presents a literature survey on the impact that AM can have on design. The survey was focused on the new opportunities of fabrication processes, the relationship between structure and performance, and optimization approaches. We applied Olsen's three-link chain model to relate product structure with performance, linked by strength, stiffness, compliance, dynamic, thermal, and visual properties. We also use this model to base our proposed Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) method. The findings show that there is a growing body of knowledge in the field of design for AM (DfAM), yet only considers a subset of properties. Furthermore, the knowledge on materials, computational optimization, computer aided design, and behavioral simulation embody separated domains and related software support. This is in contrast with design engineering, which requires a holistic approach to conceptualize new products. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 by ASME.},

Through a series of parameter studies performed with finite element models, an active spoiler was designed to control the gap between a spoiler and deployed Fowler flap. A full-scale prototype was then fabricated and tested under pseudo-aerodynamic loads. The prototype demonstrated that it can achieve the necessary deflections under the given loading condition.

The flexible 3-D-printed soft robotic gripper broadens what a robotic gripper can do, especially for grasping tasks where delicate objects, such as glassware, are involved. It consists of four pneumatic finger actuators, casings with through hole for housing the actuators, and adjustable base. The grasping length and width can be configured easily to suit a variety of objects. The soft haptic glove is equipped with flex sensors and soft pneumatic haptic actuator, which enables the users to control the grasping, to determine whether the grasp is successful, and to identify the grasped object shape. The fabric-based soft pneumatic haptic actuator can simulate haptic perception by producing force feedback to the users. Both the soft pneumatic finger actuator and haptic actuator involve simple fabrication technique, namely 3-D-printed approach and fabric-based approach, respectively, which reduce fabrication complexity as compared to the steps involved in a traditional silicone-based approach. The sensorized soft robotic gripper is capable of picking up and holding a wide variety of objects in this study, ranging from lightweight delicate object weighing less than 50 g to objects weighing 1100 g. The soft haptic actuator can produce forces of up to 2.1 N, which is more than the minimum force of 1.5 N needed to stimulate haptic perception. The subjects are able to differentiate the two objects with significant shape differences in the pilot test. Compared to the existing soft grippers, this is the first soft sensorized 3-D-printed gripper, coupled with a soft fabric-based haptic glove that has the potential to improve the robotic grasping manipulation by introducing haptic feedback to the users.},

Layer-by-layer deposition of materials to manufacture parts - better known as three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing - has been flourishing as a fabrication process in the past several years and now can create complex geometries for use as models, assembly fixtures, and production molds. Increasing interest has focused on the use of this technology for direct manufacturing of production parts. however, it remains generally limited to single-material fabrication, which can limit the end-use functionality of the fabricated structures. The next generation of 3D printing will entail not only the integration of dissimilar materials but the embedding of active components in order to deliver functionality that was not possible previously. Examples could include arbitrarily shaped electronics with integrated microfluidic thermal management and intelligent prostheses custom-fit to the anatomy of a specific patient.

Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are an attractive form of electromechanical transducer, possessing high energy densities, an efficient design, mechanical compliance, high speed, and noiseless operation. They have been incorporated into a wide variety of devices, such as microfluidic systems, cell bioreactors, tunable optics, haptic displays, and actuators for soft robotics. Fabrication of DEA devices is complex, and the majority are inefficiently made by hand. 3D printing offers an automated and flexible manufacturing alternative that can fabricate complex, multi-material, integrated devices consistently and in high resolution. We present a novel additive manufacturing approach to DEA devices in which five commercially available, thermal and UV-cure DEA silicone rubber materials have been 3D printed with a drop-on-demand, piezoelectric inkjet system. Using this process, 3D structures and high-quality silicone dielectric elastomer membranes as thin as 2 $\mu$m have been printed that exhibit mechanical and actuation performance at least as good as conventionally blade-cast membranes. Printed silicone membranes exhibited maximum tensile strains of up to 727{\%}, and DEAs with printed silicone dielectrics were actuated up to 6.1{\%} area strain at a breakdown strength of 84 V $\mu$m -1  and also up to 130 V $\mu$m -1  at 2.4{\%} strain.

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society. The direct fabrication of silicone-rubber-based individually shaped active neural implants requires high-speed-curing systems in order to prevent extensive spreading of the viscous silicone rubber materials during vulcanization. Therefore, an infrared-laser-based test setup was developed to cure the silicone rubber materials rapidly and to evaluate the resulting spreading in relation to its initial viscosity, the absorbed infrared radiation, and the surface tensions of the fabrication bed's material. Different low-adhesion materials (polyimide, Parylene-C, polytetrafluoroethylene, and fluorinated ethylenepropylene) were used as bed materials to reduce the spreading of the silicone rubber materials by means of their well-known weak surface tensions. Further, O2-plasma treatment was performed on the bed materials to reduce the surface tensions. To calculate the absorbed radiation, the emittance of the laser was measured, and the absorptances of the materials were investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection mode. A minimum silicone rubber spreading of 3.24{\%} was achieved after 2 s curing time, indicating the potential usability of the presented high-speed-curing process for the direct fabrication of thermal-curing silicone rubbers.

Countless businesses in automotive, aerospace, medical, and even food industries have adopted this approach over the past decade. Though this revolution has sparked widespread innovation with single material usage, the manufacturing world is constantly evolving. 3D printers now have the capability to create multi-material systems with performance improvements in user-definable locations. This means throughout a single component, properties like hardness, corrosion resistance, and environmental adaptation can be defined in areas that require it the most. These new processes allow for exciting multifunctional parts to be built that were never possible through traditional, single material AM processes. AM of metals, ceramics, and polymers is currently being evaluated to combine multiple materials in one operation and has already produced never-before-produced parts. While multi-material AM is still in its infancy, researchers are shifting their mindset toward this unique approach showing that the technology is beginning to advance past a research and development stage into real-world applications. This review is intended to highlight the range of 3D printed polymer-based, metal-metal, and metal-ceramic applications while discussing advantages and challenges with additively manufactured multi-material structures.},

  abstract  = {3D printing is emerging as an enabling technology for a wide range of new applications. From fundamentals point of view, the available materials, fabrication speed, and resolution of 3D printing processes must be considered for each specific application. This review provides a basic understanding of fundamentals of 3D printing processes and the recent development of novel 3D printing materials such as smart materials, ceramic materials, electronic materials, biomaterials and composites. It should be noted that the versatility of 3D printing materials comes from the variety of 3D printing systems, and all the new printers or processes for novel materials have not gone beyond the seven categories defined in ISO/ASTM standard. However, 3D printing should never be seen as a standalone process, it is becoming an integral part of a multi-process system or an integrated process of multiple systems to match the development of novel materials and new requirements of products.},

Full exploitation of the potential of soft actuators has, however, been hindered by the lack of simple manufacturing routes to generate multimaterial parts with intricate shapes and architectures. Here, we report a 3D printing platform for the seamless digital fabrication of pneumatic silicone actuators exhibiting programmable bioinspired architectures and motions. The actuators comprise an elastomeric body whose surface is decorated with reinforcing stripes at a well-defined lead angle. Similar to the fibrous architectures found in muscular hydrostats, the lead angle can be altered to achieve elongation, contraction, or twisting motions. Using a quantitative model based on lamination theory, we establish design principles for the digital fabrication of silicone-based soft actuators whose functional response is programmed within the material's properties and architecture. Exploring such programmability enables 3D printing of a broad range of soft morphing structures.},

Effects of process parameters, specifically the infill direction (0° ±45° and 90° relative to the tensile direction) and adjacent line spacing on the void formation and ultimate tensile strength are studied and compared to the baseline of stamped silicone specimens. The additive manufactured specimens with ±45° and 90° infill direction and either the minimal or small void extrusion configuration had the strongest ultimate tensile strength (average ranged from 1.44 to 1.51 MPa). This strength is close to that of the sheet stamped specimens which have an average ultimate tensile strength of 1.63 MPa. As the void size became larger and more elongated in shape, the average ultimate tensile strength significantly reduced to 1.15 and 0.90 MPa for specimens with ±45° and 90° infill direction, respectively. Counterintuitively, specimens with 0° infill direction were consistently the worst performing due to the tangency voids and poor edge surface finish resulting from the toolpath. We show that, to maximize ultimate tensile strength of silicone parts made by extrusion-based additive manufacturing, it is important to select process parameters which minimize the elongated voids, infill tangency voids, and surface edges. If these conditions can be achieved, the infill direction does not play a significant role in tensile strength of the tensile specimen.},

There is rapidly increasing interest in the improvement and diversification of properties of generic printing materials via the introduction of fillers with unique properties, and/or by blending materials exhibiting different properties to generate high performance composites. 3D printed composites have already been utilised in a wide range of applications, including biomedical, mechanical, electrical, thermal and optically enhanced products. The increasing popularity of 3D printed composites can be attributed to the ability to fabricate complex geometries, low cost production, and other advantages associated with rapid prototyping.

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Author(s). This work presents the development of a design optimization code for the geometry of the Fish Bone Active Camber morphing airfoil concept, which has been under development at Swansea University. This concept employs a biologically inspired architecture to provide highly anisotropic structural compliance, which creates smooth and continuous camber changes of large magnitude. Previous work has shown that this concept is capable of large lift coefficient control authority and significant reductions in drag over traditional trailing edge flaps. Further development of the concept requires a more robust design methodology that allows for an automated and thorough search of the available design space in order to optimize the aero-structural and system-level performance of the concept. To this end, this research extends a previously developed fluid-structure interaction analysis into a useful design tool by embedding it within a multi-objective structural optimization routine based on a genetic algorithm. The three objective functions of aerodynamic drag, added mass, and actuation energy are minimized concurrently. Example results from a specific operating condition are shown. Examination of the Pareto frontiers and the objective values of the population at large give insight into the structural behavior of the morphing concept. The objectives of mass and energy are found to be strongly competing, but good compromise points exist. The drag objective is found to be less sensitive than the others, with low drag being achievable across a range of designs with both low mass and low energy requirements, although the Pareto frontiers formed are not as well populated with regard to drag.},

Fused deposition modeling is a simple, popular and affordable technique, which is available in numerous desktop 3D printers nowadays. However, this technology is not developed considerably to co-fabricate highly stretchable (800{\%} strain) elastomer materials with low stiffness and high strength parts in one single build platform. In this paper, a single step fabrication of a novel bioinspired joint system, consisting of dissimilar materials with high strength and high strain elements is developed by an inexpensive 3D printer. The joint consists of continuous metal fibers reinforced thermoplastic part that resembles bones and soft elastomer that mimics soft tissues. Tensile test results of the 3D printed reinforced thermoplastic part showed a 78{\%} increase in strength, which can be competed with natural bone. Highly stretchable elastomer is used for the soft parts that was directly 3D printed and simultaneously cured by heating. Overall, a simple and cost effective heterogeneous material manufacturing technique is developed that maintained high mechanical strength and sufficient elasticity, to produce a bioinspired joint that composed of a rigid skeleton covered by a very soft elastomer.},

  abstract = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a 3D printing technique which allows layer-by-layer build-up of a part by the deposition of thermoplastic material through a nozzle. The technique allows for complex shapes to be made with a degree of design freedom unachievable with traditional manufacturing methods. However, the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic materials used are low compared to common engineering materials. In this work, composite 3D printing feedstocks for FFF are investigated, wherein carbon fibres are embedded into a thermoplastic matrix to increase strength and stiffness. First, the key processing parameters for FFF are reviewed, showing how fibres alter the printing dynamics by changing the viscosity and the thermal profile of the printed material. The state-of-the-art in composite 3D printing is presented, showing a distinction between short fibre feedstocks versus continuous fibre feedstocks. An experimental study was performed to benchmark these two methods. It is found that printing of continuous carbon fibres using the MarkOne printer gives significant increases in performance over unreinforced thermoplastics, with mechanical properties in the same order of magnitude of typical unidirectional epoxy matrix composites. The method, however, is limited in design freedom as the brittle continuous carbon fibres cannot be deposited freely through small steering radii and sharp angles. Filaments with embedded short carbon microfibres (∼100 $\mu$m) show better print capabilities and are suitable for use with standard printing methods, but only offer a slight increase in mechanical properties over the pure thermoplastic properties. It is hypothesized that increasing the fibre length in short fibre filament is expected to lead to increased mechanical properties, potentially approaching those of continuous fibre composites, whilst keeping the high degree of design freedom of the FFF process.},

abstract = {Most materials shrink laterally like a rubber band when stretched, so their Poisson's ratios are positive. Likewise, most materials contract in all directions when hydrostatically compressed and decrease density when stretched, so they have positive linear compressibilities. We found that the in-plane Poisson's ratio of carbon nanotube sheets (buckypaper) can be tuned from positive to negative by mixing single-walled and multiwalled nanotubes. Density-normalized sheet toughness, strength, and modulus were substantially increased by this mixing. A simple model predicts the sign and magnitude of Poisson's ratio for buckypaper from the relative ease of nanofiber bending and stretch, and explains why the Poisson's ratios of ordinary writing paper are positive and much larger. Theory also explains why the negative in-plane Poisson's ratio is associated with a large positive Poisson's ratio for the sheet thickness, and predicts that hydrostatic compression can produce biaxial sheet expansion. This tunability of Poisson's ratio can be exploited in the design of sheet-derived composites, artificial muscles, gaskets, and chemical and mechanical sensors.},

At the conclusion of the article, we summarize the most significant achievements and address the future challenges and tasks in the area related to characterizing VGCNF aspect ratio and dispersion, determining the influence of processing methods and conditions on VGCNF/polymer composites and understanding the structure/property relationship in VGCNF/polymer composites. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {The work introduces a novel reduced order model (ROM) technique to describe the dynamic behavior of turbofan aeroengine blades. We introduce an equivalent 3D frame model to describe the coupled flexural/torsional mode shapes, with their relevant natural frequencies and associated modal masses. The frame configurations are identified through a structural identification approach based on a simulated annealing algorithm with stochastic tunneling. The cost functions are constituted by linear combinations of relative errors associated to the resonance frequencies, the individual modal assurance criteria (MAC), and on either overall static or modal masses. When static masses are considered the optimized 3D frame can represent the blade dynamic behavior with an 8{\%} error on the MAC, a 1{\%} error on the associated modal frequencies and a 1{\%} error on the overall static mass. When using modal masses in the cost function the performance of the ROM is similar, but the overall error increases to 7{\%}. The approach proposed in this paper is considerably more accurate than state-of-the-art blade ROMs based on traditional Timoshenko beams, and provides excellent accuracy at reduced computational time when compared against high fidelity FE models. A sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed model can adequately predict the global trends of the variations of the natural frequencies when lumped masses are used for mistuning analysis. The proposed ROM also follows extremely closely the sensitivity of the high fidelity finite element models when the material parameters are used in the sensitivity.},

In addition, the fracture strain also enhanced distinctly, implying that MWCNTs loading not only elevated the tensile strength of the epoxy matrix, but also increased the fracture toughness.

  abstract  = {Epoxy resins are widely applied in cryogenic engineering and their cryogenic mechanical properties as important parameters have to be improved to meet the high requirements by cryogenic engineering applications. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are regarded as exceptional reinforcements for polymers. However, poor carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer interfacial bonding leads to the unexpected low reinforcing efficiency. This paper presents a study on the cryogenic mechanical properties of multi-walled carbon nanotube reinforced epoxy nanocomposites, which are prepared by adding multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-F epoxy via the ultrasonic technique. When the temperature decreases from room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K), a strong CNT-epoxy interfacial bonding is observed due to the thermal contraction of epoxy matrix because of the big differences in thermal expansion coefficients of epoxy and MWCNTs, resulting in a higher reinforcing efficiency. Moreover, synthetic sequence leads to selective dispersion of MWCNTs in the brittle primary phase but not in the soft second phase in the two phase epoxy matrix. Consequently, the cryogenic tensile strength, Young's modulus, failure strain and impact strength at 77 K are all enhanced by the addition of MWCNTs at appropriate contents. The results suggest that CNTs are promising reinforcements for enhancing the cryogenic mechanical properties of epoxy resins that have potential applications in cryogenic engineering areas. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanical tensile tests and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) show that the Young modulus increases as the content of the nanotubes increases. Compared with pure PA1010, the Young's modulus and the storage modulus of MWNTs/PA1010 in situ composites are significantly improved by ca. 87.3{\%} and 197{\%} (at 0 °C), respectively, when the content of MWNTs is 30.0 wt{\%}. The elongation at break of MWNTs/PA1010 composites decreases with increasing proportion of MWNTs. For the composites containing 1.0 wt{\%} MWNTs, the Young modulus increases by ca. 27.4{\%}, while the elongation at break only decreases by ca. 5.4{\%} as compared with pure PA1010 prepared under the same experimental conditions. Compared with mechanical blending of MWNTs with pure PA1010, the in situ-prepared composites exhibit a much higher Young's modulus, indicating that the in situ polycondensation method improves mechanical strength of nanocomposites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging showed that MWNTs on the fractured surfaces of the composites are uniformly dispersed and exhibit strong interfacial adhesion with the polymer matrix. Moreover, unique crystallization and melting behaviors for MWNTs/PA1010 in situ composites are observed using a combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction methods. It was shown that only the $\alpha$-form crystals are observed in our MWNTs/PA1010 in situ composites.

We review the present state of polymer nanocomposites research in which the fillers are carbon nanotubes. In order to enhance their chemical affinity to engineering polymer matrices, chemical modification of the graphitic sidewalls and tips is necessary. In this review, an extended account of the various chemical strategies for grafting polymers onto carbon nanotubes and the manufacturing of carbon nanotube/polymer nanocomposites is given. The mechanical and electrical properties to date of a whole range of nanocomposites of various carbon nanotube contents are also reviewed in an attempt to facilitate progress in this emerging area. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  issn     = {1743-3541},
  abstract = {Today's architectural foils and membranes amaze with their superior strength-to- weight ratio and are often implemented as lightweight building envelopes or shading devices. Most claddings, however, are optimized for high tensile strength, which reduces the design possibilities to pre-stressed inflexible shapes. Only few projects are exploring the potential inherent in the membrane's low bending stiffness. Nowadays, new materials and manufacturing methods allow for customized pliability of semi-rigid thin-shell structures, which fully tap the potential of reversible elastic deformation. While this concept is hardly been used in architecture, convertible surfaces are rampant in nature. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review in general how nature's soft, flexible, and force- adaptive structures may inspire the development of technical membrane structures and outline their architectural potential in particular. Focusing on bio- inspired pliable systems that show distinct curved-line folding principles will be the framework for a close collaboration among architects, engineers, and biologists. Examining the flower opening of Ipomoea alba will clarify the drawbacks and opportunities of elastic kinematics. Therefore, the first part of the study will introduce this nocturnal flower, whose environmentally responsive petals adapt their geometry in a circadian rhythm. Morphological and anatomical analyses will secondly lead to a better understanding of their primarily turgor- dependent cascade of multiple motion sequences. Examining the interaction of geometrically constraint surfaces and material-specific stress distribution in the flower's curved-line folding is thereby of particular interest. The plant's pattern will thirdly be abstracted and the interdependencies be tested in digital models. Recording their packaging efficiency, mechanical simplicity, and structural characteristics, will fourthly make the systems comparable. Finally, the project will deduce the physical principles by tracking the plant's kinematics and outline their use for architectural foils and membranes with similar adaptive behavior.},

Existing rapid prototyping techniques (e.g., 3-D printing) can achieve complex geometries and are becoming increasingly accessible. however, they are limited to one or two materials and cannot seamlessly integrate active components. We propose an alternative approach called printable robots that takes advantage of available planar fabrication methods to create integrated electromechanical laminates that are subsequently folded into functional 3-D machines employing origami-inspired techniques. We designed, fabricated, and tested prototype origami robots to address the canonical robotics challenges of mobility and manipulation, and subsequently combined these designs to generate a new, multifunctional machine. The speed of the design and manufacturing process as well as the ease of composing designs create a new paradigm in robotic development, which has the promise to democratize access to customized robots for industrial, home, and educational use.},

abstract = {Programmable matter is a material whose properties can be programmed to achieve specific shapes or stiffnesses upon command. This concept requires constituent elements to interact and rearrange intelligently in order to meet the goal. This paper considers achieving programmable sheets that can form themselves in different shapes autonomously by folding. Past approaches to creating transforming machines have been limited by the small feature sizes, the large number of components, and the associated complexity of communication among the units. We seek to mitigate these difficulties through the unique concept of self-folding origami with universal crease patterns. This approach exploits a single sheet composed of interconnected triangular sections. The sheet is able to fold into a set of predetermined shapes using embedded actuation. To implement this self-folding origami concept, we have developed a scalable end-to-end planning and fabrication process. Given a set of desired objects, the system computes an optimized design for a single sheet and multiple controllers to achieve each of the desired objects. The material, called programmable matter by folding, is an example of a system capable of achieving multiple shapes for multiple functions.},

The pattern of folds on the foil was produced by negative photochemical etching.

This reversible origami-like folding pattern proceeds via a cooperative flexing-and-packing mechanism actuated by a swellable cellulose layer filling specialized plant cells. Swelling is translated into a bidirectional organ movement through simple geometric constraints embedded in the hierarchical architecture of the ice plant valves. Extracted principles from this reliable and reversible actuated movement have relevance to the emerging field of 'programmable matter' with applications as far-reaching as the design of satellites and artificial muscles.},

  abstract  = {The ability of plants to move is central to many physiological processes from development to tropisms, from nutrition to reproduction. The movement of plants or plant parts occurs over a wide range of sizes and time scales. This review summarizes the main physical mechanisms plants use to achieve motility, highlighting recent work at the frontier of biology and physics on rapid movements. Emphasis is given to presenting in a single framework pioneering biological studies of water transport and growth with more recent physics research on poroelasticity and mechanical instabilities. First, the basic osmotic and hydration/dehydration motors are described that contribute to movement by growth and reversible swelling/shrinking of cells and tissues. The speeds of these water-driven movements are shown to be ultimately limited by the transport of water through the plant body. Some plant structures overcome this hydraulic limit to achieve much faster movement by using a mechanical instability. The principle is to impose an 'energy barrier' to the system, which can originate from geometrical constraint or matter cohesion, allowing elastic potential energy to be stored until the barrier is overcome, then rapidly transformed into kinetic energy. Three of these rapid motion mechanisms have been elucidated recently and are described here: the snapping traps of two carnivorous plants, the Venus flytrap and Utricularia, and the catapult of fern sporangia. Finally, movement mechanisms are reconsidered in the context of the timescale of important physiological processes at the cellular and molecular level.},

This question is also central to infectious disease epidemiology, where changes in disease incidence due to behavioural or environmental change must be distinguished from the nonlinear dynamics of the parasite population. Repeated epidemics of primary and secondary syphilis infection in the United States over the past 50 yr have previously been attributed to social and behavioural changes. Here, we show that these epidemics represent a rare example of unforced, endogenous oscillations in disease incidence, with an 8-11-yr period that is predicted by the natural dynamics of syphilis infection, to which there is partially protective immunity. This conclusion is supported by the absence of oscillations in gonorrhoea cases, where a protective immune response is absent. We further demonstrate increased synchrony of syphilis oscillations across cities over time, providing empirical evidence for an increasingly connected sexual network in the United States.},

  abstract = {Although there is mounting evidence that passive mechanical dynamics of insect wings play an integral role in insect flight, our understanding of the structural details underlying insect wing flexibility remains incomplete. Here, we use comparative morphological and mechanical techniques to illuminate the function and diversity of two mechanisms within Odonata wings presumed to affect dynamic wing deformations: flexible resilin vein-joints and cuticular spikes. Mechanical tests show that joints with more resilin have lower rotational stiffness and deform more in response to a load applied to an intact wing. Morphological studies of 12 species of Odonata reveal that resilin joints and cuticular spikes are widespread taxonomically, yet both traits display a striking degree of morphological and functional diversity that follows taxonomically distinct patterns. Interestingly, damselfly wings (suborder Zygoptera) are mainly characterized by vein-joints that are double-sided (containing resilin both dorsally and ventrally), whereas dragonfly wings (suborder Epiprocta) are largely characterized by single-sided vein-joints (containing resilin either ventrally or dorsally, but not both). The functional significance and diversity of resilin joints and cuticular spikes could yield insight into the evolutionary relationship between form and function of wings, as well as revealing basic principles of insect wing mechanical design.},

Occurrence of resilin, a rubber-like protein, in some mobile joints together with data on wing unfolding and flight kinematics suggest that resilin in the beetle wing has multiple functions. First, the distribution pattern of resilin in the wing correlates with the particular folding pattern of the wing. Second, our data show that resilin occurs at the places where extra elasticity is needed, for example in wing folds, to prevent material damage during repeated folding and unfolding. Third, resilin provides the wing with elasticity in order to be deformable by aerodynamic forces. This may result in elastic energy storage in the wing.},

  abstract = {Representatives of Dermaptera probably have the most unusual hind wing venation and folding pattern among insects. Both correlate with unusual wing folding mechanics, in which folding is achieved from within the wing and unfolding is done by the cerci. In this account, the hind wings of the earwig Forficula auricularia were studied by means of bright field and fluorescence microscopy. Resilin, a rubber-like protein, was revealed in several, clearly defined patches. It occurs dorsally in the radiating veins, but ventrally in the intercalary vein. This distribution determines the folding direction, and resilin is the major driving mechanism for wing folding. Resilin stores elastic energy in broadened vein patches and along the folds. At the other locations, the mid-wing mechanism and central area, the primary function of resilin is suggested to be prevention of material failure. The arrangement of resilin patches is such that the wing cannot be unfolded from the thorax proper but must be unfolded by the cerci. In Dermaptera, the antagonistic movements of folding and unfolding are achieved in two different ways, resilin and cerci. To our knowledge this is unique. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract  = {This thesis lies at the intersection of architectural design, engineering, and biology. Inspired by flexible and robust structures found in nature, the research explores creative ideas that challenge our present understanding of mechanical constructions and offers an alternative to the prevailing paradigm of rigid-body mechanics. By exploring how the motion principles in flexible plant movements can be understood, abstracted, and transferred into novel design and fabrication processes. this thesis proposes innovative concepts that integrate hitherto neglected structural behaviors, such as bending and buckling. These behaviors are considered potential design drivers in the development of new kinetic structures. The first section offers a comparison between Kinetic Structures in Design and Kinetic Structures in Biology. While at first glance these two areas may seem entirely unrelated, they share much in common. A particularly interesting connection is provided by compliant mechanisms where technical devices obtain their motion by the flexibility of their members and functionalize large elastic deformations. With these characteristics they are not that dissimilar to the motion principles found in plant leaves. The second section on Methodology is devoted to the transfer of knowledge between technology and biology. This section introduces the emerging science of biomimetics and generally discusses its working methods while also outlining its practical use for this research. In the third section of this thesis, a transdisciplinary framework is employed for a series of Case Studies. Here, seven exemplary plant movements are closely investigated and their underlying motion principles are recreated by means of modern computational simulation techniques. Based on these insights various bio-inspired compliant mechanisms are developed and transferred into adaptive facades shading systems. In the following section on Implementations, this technology is utilized for providing sun protection to double- curved building facades and showcased on three conceptual projects. The thesis concludes with a reflection on the Research Contributions and Future Outlook of this work and thereby invites the next generation of researchers and designers to build up on this work, keeping these newly created bonds between the disciplines alive.},

These motions are achieved without muscles and they have inspired a wide spectrum of engineered materials and structures. This review summarizes the recent developments of plant-inspired adaptive structures and materials for morphing and actuation. We begin with a brief overview of the actuation strategies and physiological features associated to these plant movements, showing that different combinations of these strategies and features can lead to motions with different deformation characteristics and response speeds. Then we offer a comprehensive survey of the plant-inspired morphing and actuation systems, including pressurized cellular structures, osmotic actuation, anisotropic hygroscopic materials, and bistable systems for rapid movements. Although these engineered systems are vastly different in terms of their size scales and intended applications, their working principles are all related to the actuation strategies and physiological features in plants. This review is to promote future cross-disciplinary studies between plant biology and engineering, which can foster new solutions for many applications such as morphing airframes, soft robotics and kinetic architectures.},

Self-folding is driven by differential swelling of the two PEG bilayers in aqueous solutions. We characterize the self-folding of PEG bilayers of varying composition and develop a finite element model which predicts radii of curvature that are in good agreement with empirical results. Since we envision the utility of bio-origami in tissue engineering, we photoencapsulate insulin secreting $\beta$-TC-6 cells within PEG bilayers and subsequently self-fold them into cylindrical hydrogels of different radii. Calcein AM staining and ELISA measurements are used to monitor cell proliferation and insulin production respectively, and the results indicate cell viability and robust insulin production for over eight weeks in culture.},

In particular, we point out examples where biaxial compression of an elastically supported thin film, such as that due to differential growth, shrinkage, desiccation, or thermal expansion, spontaneously generates these patterns, and we provide a simple theoretical explanation for their occurrence.},

The mechanisms, which have one degree of freedom, are in effect lever systems, whose velocity ratios change non-linearly as they operate. They are designated as `Internal' (INT) and `External' (EXT), and further specified by a plus or minus sign, derived from the convex or concave orientation of the folding lines. There are hence four possible combinations: INT-, INT+, EXT- and EXT+. The two types are kinematically distinct. As INT unfolds, the effector panels move slowly at first and accelerate towards the end of the movement, whereas in EXT the effector panels move fast initially, then decelerate rapidly to their their final position. Furthermore INT operates reversibly, whereas EXT usually needs to be closed elastically, or by an extraneous force. The principles of the two mechanisms are applicable to many other folding structures.},

  abstract  = {Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has inspired the design of engineering devices and$\backslash$r structures for decades. The underlying principles of origami are very general, which has led to$\backslash$r applications ranging from cardboard containers to deployable space structures. More recently,$\backslash$r researchers have become interested in the use of active materials (i.e., those that convert various$\backslash$r forms of energy into mechanical work) to effect the desired folding behavior. When used in a$\backslash$r suitable geometry, active materials allow engineers to create self-folding structures. Such$\backslash$r structures are capable of performing folding and/or unfolding operations without being kinematically$\backslash$r manipulated by external forces or moments. This is advantageous for many applications including$\backslash$r space systems, underwater robotics, small scale devices, and self-assembling systems. This article$\backslash$r is a survey and analysis of prior work on active self-folding structures as well as methods and$\backslash$r tools available for the design of folding structures in general and self-folding structures in$\backslash$r particular. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic view of the$\backslash$r state-of-the-art in this important and evolving area. Unifying structural principles for active$\backslash$r self-folding structures are identified and used as a basis for a quantitative and qualitative$\backslash$r comparison of numerous classes of active materials. Design considerations specific to folded$\backslash$r structures are examined, including the issues of crease pattern identification and fold kinematics.$\backslash$r Although few tools have been created with active materials in mind, many of them are useful in the$\backslash$r overall design process for active self-folding structures. Finally, the article concludes with a$\backslash$r discussion of open questions for the field of origami-inspired engineering.},

The material consists of multiple cells made from silicone rubber with locally reinforced regions based upon kirigami principles. On pneumatic actuation these cells fold or unfold based on the fold lines created by the interaction of the geometry with the reinforced regions. Each cell is able to maintain its shape in either a retracted or deployed state, without the aid of mechanisms or sustained actuation, due to the existence of structural bistability. Mathematical quantification of the surface texture is introduced, based on out-of-plane deviations of a deployed structure compared to a reference plane. Additionally, finite element analysis is employed to characterize the geometry and stability of an individual cell during actuation and retraction. This investigation highlights the critical role that angular rotation, at the center of each cell, plays on the deployment angle as it transitions through the elastically deployed configuration. The analysis of this novel concept is presented and a pneumatically actuated proof-of-concept demonstrator is fabricated.},

  abstract = {During the past decade, interest has grown tremendously in the design and synthesis of crystalline materials constructed from molecular clusters linked by extended groups of atoms. Most notable are metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), in which polyatomic inorganic metal-containing clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from molecular building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chemistry. MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net. Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallographic studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported. In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them. In the case of MOFs, polyatomic groups act as the vertices and edges of the net. Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topological structures. We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use. In this Account, we explain the underlying methodology of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes. The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers. The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chemical compounds or both. In the latter case, references to occurrences are provided. We describe some crystallographic, topological, and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database. We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural analysis of new materials. Associated with each net is a natural tiling, which is a natural partition of space into space-filling tiles. The database allows export of data that can be used to analyze and illustrate such tilings.},

  abstract  = {Hydrogen gas is increasingly studied as a potential replacement for fossil fuels because fossil fuel supplies are depleting rapidly and the devastating environmental impacts of their use can no longer be ignored. H2 is a promising replacement energy storage molecule because it has the highest energy density of all common fuels by weight. One area in which replacing fossil fuels will have a large impact is in automobiles, which currently operate almost exclusively on gasoline. Due to the size and weight constraints in vehicles, on board hydrogen must be stored in a small, lightweight system. This is particularly challenging for hydrogen because it has the lowest energy density of common fuels by volume. Therefore, a lot of research is invested in finding a compact, safe, reliable, inexpensive and energy efficient method of H 2 storage. Mechanical compression as well as storage in chemical hydrides and absorption to carbon substrates has been investigated. An overview of all systems including the current research and potential benefits and issue are provided in the present paper. {\textcopyright} 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Molecular hydrogen storage in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is one possibility for on-board storage in fuel-cell vehicles, but so far generally only the gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity has been considered. Here we analyze the volumetric absolute hydrogen uptake of many MOFs measured at 77K and 2.0-2.5MPa in our laboratory in recent years and correlate these to their structure. A linear relation is found for the volumetric absolute hydrogen uptake as a function of the volumetric surface area, which yields the same hydrogen surface density as in Chahine's rule. Furthermore, the experimental data show a correlation between the specific volume and the specific surface area, which is used to develop a phenomenological model for the volumetric absolute uptake as a function of the gravimetric absolute uptake. Most of the MOFs follow this relation. However, the interpenetrated framework, CFA-7, shows the strongest deviation and the highest volumetric absolute hydrogen storage capacity at 77K and 2.0MPa.},

Examples taken from actual applications are worked out in detail to show how the concepts are applied, solving the same design problem with different methods based on different drivers (e.g. cost or weight) to show how the final configuration changes as the requirements and approach change. • Provides a toolkit of analysis and design methods to most situations encountered in practice, as well as analytical frameworks and the means to solving them for tackling less frequent problems. • Presents solutions applicable to optimization schemes without having to run finite element models at each iteration, speeding up the design process and allowing examination of several more alternatives than traditional approaches. • Includes guidelines showing how decisions based on manufacturing considerations affect weight and how weight optimization may adversely affect the cost. • Accompanied by a website at www.wiley.com/go/kassapoglou hosting lecture slides and solutions to the exercises for instructors. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

We develop an explanation for this phenomenon that draws on standard tools from the literature on graphical causal models and, in particular, on the idea of probabilistic sampling. Using these tools, we propose a new measure of actual causal strength. This measure accurately captures three effects of normality on causal judgment that have been observed in existing studies. More importantly, the measure predicts a new effect (“abnormal deflation”). Two studies show that people's judgments do, in fact, show this new effect. Taken together, the patterns of people's causal judgments thereby provide support for the proposed explanation.},

  abstract    = {Recent developments have seen an expansion in the use of composite materials in structural applications involving thickness sections in excess of 20 mm, often complex in shape. The general perception has been to associate through-thickness properties with thick composites, whereas in fact an equally important issue relates to the measurement of in-plane properties and the effect of physical size of test specimens on measured data. Although extensive developmental work has been undertaken worldwide into test methods and design procedures for in-plane properties of thin laminates, there are no standard test methods available that provide guidance on testing of thick composite sections. The approach generally adopted has been to use existing standards, developed for testing small laboratory- scale specimens, with non-standard (i.e. larger) specimen geometries. A major concern relates to whether data generated from standards for relatively thin specimens are equivalent to or representative of thick section mechanical behaviour. This report reviews key issues relating to mechanical testing of thick composite sections, highlighting issues that need to be resolved or better understood in order for these materials to fulfil their full market potential. The report covers in Part I tension, compression, shear, flexure and multi-axial loading conditions, environmental, impact and fatigue resistance, and issues relating to manufacture and inspection of thick laminates. Work undertaken to assess the effects of cure on thick laminate properties and to formulate an optimised cure cycle for a 20 mm thick carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) material is detailed in Part II. Recommendations are provided as to future work required for test method development for thick composite laminates.},

  abstract = {Composites are far from a new invention, and have through time taken many shapes. From a simple hay clay house to advanced nano particle containing composites for advanced material applications. Since the industrialisation in the late 1800's the use of fibre reinforced composites have increased significantly. The usage span wide, from furniture and car components to construction materials. Even though, the concept of composites is well known and widely applied, the fundamental principles of the interaction of the constituents, in the composites are still not fully understood. This thesis is a part of Danish Center for Composite Structures and Materials for wind turbine blades who work towards improving composites. Since wind turbine blades are the basis of the DCCSM it is the materials used here that are the focus, explicitly glass fibres and epoxy matrix. Glass fibre composites greatly dominate the fibre reinforced composite industry due to the combination of their relatively high stiffness and low production cost. During manufacturing the glass fibres are applied a coating, called sizing, for protection of the fibres and for compatibility with the polymer matrix. The sizing is located at the interface between glass fibre and polymer matrix. Despite the importance of this interface, in regards to the stress transfer, which is responsible for the reinforcing effect of fibres, very little research address how the interface is affected and how it can be controlled. This thesis covers an analysis of the sizing from the glass fibre surface to the interface in composites. Through soxhlet extraction with acetone it was possible to remove a part of the sizing from the glass fibres for analysis. By burning off the sizing at 565 C a higher mass loss was obtained than from the extraction, indicating that a part of the sizing might be covalently bonded to the glass fibre surface. The investigation of the sizing extract by ATR-FTIR and TGA-MS revealed the presence of a DGEBA film former as one of the components of the sizing. Glass plates were successfully coated with the organosilanes APTMS and GPTMS in order to mimic the surface of the glass fibres. The non-planar surface of glass fibres yields difficulties in some analysis e.g. determination of contact angle. The plates displayed a clear difference in contact angle after being coated towards a more polar surface. An investigation of the adhesion between fibre and matrix analysed by microbond testing and the determination of the IFSS was conducted varying the amine:epoxide group ratio in the matrix and the testing temperature. IFSS was found to be affected by both parameters. A maximum IFSS was observed around the stoichiometric ratio of amine:epoxide group (1:1). The presence of amine or epoxide groups in the sizing will affect the ratio at the interface and in all probability also the IFSS with a decrease in IFSS as the result. Furthermore, the testing temperature influenced the IFSS. The highest values were obtained at room temperature. Above the glass transition temperature the dependency of the amine:epoxide group ratio changed to become linear. Two different microbond setups were used for the determination of the IFSS and a difference was detected. It was explained by the difference in loading procedure. one had constant strain rate and the other constant load rate. Additionally the duration of the microbond test might also influence the determination of the IFSS. The influence on the mechanical properties stiffness, strength and J-integral by changes in the chemistry of the interface was investigated. The stiffness of single glass fibres increased after the removal of sizing by extraction but also when the sizing was removed by burning. This could partly be explained by the sizing being less dense than the glass fibres. For the III burned glass fibres compactment of the glass structure also yields an increase in stiffness. The fibre strength was less affected by the extraction of sizing but burning drastically decreased the strength. The enlargement of surface flaws after the removal of the protective sizing is given as the cause of the decrease in strength. Coating of fibres after extraction of the original sizing by the organosilane GPTMS resulted only in insignificant changes of stiffness and strength of single glass fibres. However the effect on the adhesion measured by the Jintegral was remarkable. Small scale specimens were successfully used for the DCB testing and the determination of the J-integral. The GPTMS modified fibres displayed significant higher interface adhesion in comparison to the fibres with the original sizing. From this it had been proved that the original sizing is far from the optimal when it comes to facilitating a strong adhesion between glass fibre and matrix.},

Fatigue behavior of hybrid as well as glass and carbon fiber reinforced composites with and without secondary CNT reinforcement is simulated using multiscale 3D unit cells. The materials behavior under both mechanical cyclic loading and combined mechanical and environmental loading (with phase properties degraded due to the moisture effects) is studied. The multiscale unit cells are generated automatically using the Python based code. 3D computational studies of environment and fatigue analyses of multiscale composites with secondary nano-scale reinforcement in different material phases and different CNTs arrangements are carried out systematically in this paper. It was demonstrated that composites with the secondary CNT reinforcements (especially, aligned tubes) present superior fatigue performances than those without reinforcements, also under combined environmental and cyclic mechanical loading. This effect is stronger for carbon composites, than for hybrid and glass composites.},

Eventually, it compromises the integrity of blade surfaces. Elastomeric coatings are currently used for erosion resistance, yet the life of such coatings cannot be predicted accurately. This review paper gives an overview of experimentally validated erosion model blocks that can be used to predict the life of the leading edge of coated wind turbine blades. From the reviewed work it is concluded that surface fatigue, as nucleating wear mechanism for erosion damage, can explain erosive wear and failure of the coatings. An engineering approach to surface fatigue, using the Palmgren-Miner rule for cumulative damage, allows for the construction of a rain erosion incubation period equation. Coating life was described as a function of the rain intensity, the droplet diameter, the fatigue properties of the coating and the severity of the conditions. It is recommended to focus coating development on reduction of the impact pressure, e.g. by developing surfaces with a low modulus of elasticity. or on enlarging the safe area by: developing coatings with adjustable compressive stresses and hardness, or coatings without defects and impurities. Off shore wind energy locations give rise to leading edge erosion of the turbine blades by droplet impingement.},

Wind turbine and the rotorblade concepts are reviewed, and loadings by wind and gravity as important factors for the fatigue performance of the materials are considered. Wood and composites are discussed as candidates for rotorblades. The fibers and matrices for composites are described, and their high stiffness, low density, and good fatigue performance are emphasized. Manufacturing technologies for composites are presented and evaluated with respect to advantages, problems, and industrial potential. The important technologies of today are prepreg (pre-impregnated) technology and resin infusion technology. The mechanical properties of fiber composite materials are discussed, with a focus on fatigue performance. Damage and materials degradation during fatigue are described. Testing procedures for documentation of properties are reviewed, and fatigue loading histories are discussed, together with methods for data handling and statistical analysis of (large) amounts of test data. Future challenges for materials in the field of wind turbines are presented, with a focus on thermoplastic composites, new structural materials concepts, new structural design aspects, structural health monitoring, and the coming trends and markets for wind energy.},

Passive isolators are used to isolate the payloads from the vibrating structure but this type of isolation has no effect on the acoustic excitations. This study focuses on methods for achieving active damping on plate structures by means of piezoelectric actuators (PZTs). An experiment was conducted using PZT actuators and accelerometers mounted on a rectangular plate with an active damping controller implemented on a 486 computer.

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE. For bio-inspired, fish-like robotic propulsion, the Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) piezoelectric technology offers noiseless actuation with a balance between actuation force and velocity response. However, internal nonlinear- ities within the MFCs, such as piezoelectric softening, geometric hardening, inertial softening, and nonlinear dissipation, couple with the hydrodynamic loading on the structure from the surrounding fluid. In the present work, we explore nonlinear actuation of MFC cantilevers underwater and develop a mathematical framework for modeling and analysis. In vacuo resonant actuation experiments are conducted for a set of MFC cantilevers of varying length to width aspect ratios to validate the structural model in the absence of fluid loading. These MFC cantilevers are then subjected to underwater resonant actuation experiments, and model simulations are compared with nonlinear experimental frequency response functions. It is observed that semi-empirical hydro- dynamic loads obtained from quasilinear experiments have to be modified to account for amplitude dependent added mass, and additional nonlinear hydrodynamic effects might be present, yielding qualitative differences in the resulting underwater frequency respones curves with increased excitation amplitude.},

The aircraft layout at the end of the phase is referred to as the baseline configuration. Between these two milestones there are a number of distinctive, and partially sequential, stages to be investigated. An excellent way for design teams to begin preliminary process is to understand the design problems. Later stages of the design process benefit from knowledge of existing work published in the area of the project. Searching for such information involves three tasks: finding data on existing and competitive aircraft finding technical reports and articles relating to the project area and any advanced technologies to be incorporated and gathering operational experience. For all aircraft designs, it is essential to know the airworthiness regulations that are appropriate. With a fully described set of regulations, knowledge of existing aircraft data and a complete understanding of the problem, it is now possible to start the technical design tasks. In initial baseline sizing stage, the object should be to reduce the list to a single preferred option but sometimes this is not possible and one may needs to take another one or two into the next design stage. Once decisions have been made on the configurations to be further considered it is necessary to size the aircraft. A three-view general arrangement scale drawing for each aircraft configuration will be required. The design method that follows is an iterative process that usually converges on a feasible configuration quickly.},

  abstract = {Servovalves are compact, accurate and high-bandwidth modulating valves widely used in aerospace, defence, industrial and marine applications. However, manufacturing costs are high due to high part count and tight tolerances required, particularly in the first stage of the valve, and due to manual adjustments required as part of the set-up process. In this research, a novel servovalve concept is investigated that has the potential to be more cost-effective. In particular, for the first time, a piezoelectric first-stage actuator is developed to move a servovalve spool using the deflector jet principle. this is especially suited to aerospace actuation requirements. In the new valve, the conventional electromagnetic torque motor is replaced by a multilayer bimorph piezoelectric actuator. The bimorph deflects a jet of fluid to create a pressure differential across the valve spool, hence the spool moves. A feedback wire is used to facilitate proportional spool posi-tion control via mechanical feedback. The bimorph is directly coupled to the feedback wire and is immersed in hydraulic fluid. A high-order non-linear model of the valve has been developed and used to predict valve static and dynamic char-acteristics and is described in this article. This makes use of stiffness constants derived analytically for the bimorph-feedback wire assembly and cross-referenced to finite element analysis predictions. The model of the flow force acting on the deflector is an approximation of the force characteristic found from computation fluid dynamic analysis. The mea-sured characteristics of the prototype valve are in good agreement with the simulation results and prove that the opera-tional concept is viable.},

Owing to their efficiency and simplicity, selectively compliant structures are regarded as a possible solution. To identify the challenges connected with the design of morphing wing so- lutions, an existing 2D compliant morphing rib structure is implemented into a 3D wing design. The results indicate the adverse effect on the ob- tained performance of 3D coupling phenomena and of discrepancies in the obtained shape. To address the identified limitations, the morphing concept is modified by introducing a compliant element in the skin and by developing a new three- dimensional, aero-structural design approach. The results at different design speeds indicate that the wing can produce a considerable roll controllability. To provide further insight of the advantages and disadvantages of the morphing solution, the obtained performance is compared to the one of a conventional wing. As morphing skins are identified as critical structural elements, the opti- mal structural properties of a generic passive morphing skin design are in- vestigated. Particularly, the results indicate the need for a high anisotropy, both between membrane and flexural properties and between the skin's principal directions. Based on the obtained results, a novel, doubly corrugated morphing skin is introduced. Numerical and experimental tests show that the proposed skin features an exceptional ratio between the axial and the bending stiffness in the compliant direction. Parametric results obtained with nonlinear concur- rent optimisations indicate that the double corrugation can potentially ad- dress the conflicting requirements of morphing skins. To offset the aerodynamic penalty of the non-smooth profile, the corruga- tion is covered with an electro-bonded, continuous skin. Furthermore, the obtained semi-active system is able to increase the dissipative properties of the structure, thus preventing the occurrence of large vibrations connected with the highly compliant deformation modes. The effectiveness of the double corrugation as morphing skin is demon- strated by designing, manufacturing, and testing a morphing wing. The re- sults indicate that the wing has a lower or equivalent weight compared to conventional wings. Wind tunnel tests show that the shape changes occur in an aerodynamic efficient way and that the achieved controllability allows for replacing conventional ailerons.},

  abstract = {Background According to the body-specificity hypothesis, people with different bodily characteristics should form correspondingly different mental representations, even in highly abstract conceptual domains. In a previous test of this proposal, right- and left-handers were found to associate positive ideas like intelligence, attractiveness, and honesty with their dominant side and negative ideas with their non-dominant side. The goal of the present study was to determine whether ‘body-specific' associations of space and valence can be observed beyond the laboratory in spontaneous behavior, and whether these implicit associations have visible consequences. Methodology and Principal Findings We analyzed speech and gesture (3012 spoken clauses, 1747 gestures) from the final debates of the 2004 and 2008 US presidential elections, which involved two right-handers (Kerry, Bush) and two left-handers (Obama, McCain). Blind, independent coding of speech and gesture allowed objective hypothesis testing. Right- and left-handed candidates showed contrasting associations between gesture and speech. In both of the left-handed candidates, left-hand gestures were associated more strongly with positive-valence clauses and right-hand gestures with negative-valence clauses the opposite pattern was found in both right-handed candidates. Conclusions Speakers associate positive messages more strongly with dominant hand gestures and negative messages with non-dominant hand gestures, revealing a hidden link between action and emotion. This pattern cannot be explained by conventions in language or culture, which associate ‘good' with ‘right' but not with ‘left' rather, results support and extend the body-specificity hypothesis. Furthermore, results suggest that the hand speakers use to gesture may have unexpected (and probably unintended) communicative value, providing the listener with a subtle index of how the speaker feels about the content of the co-occurring speech.},

This method solves the problem by splitting the 3-D nonlinear problem into 1-D analysis through the thickness and 2-D nonlinear shell analysis. This paper concludes with a discussion of future scope and difficulties in design and analysis of multifunctional composite structures.},

The primary technical challenge addressed by this work is the use of this method to design and fabricate low density, highly compliant robotic structures with spatially tuned stiffness. This approach offers a number of potential advantages over more conventional methods for constructing compliant robots. The discrete assembly reduces manufacturing complexity, as relatively simple parts can be batch-produced and joined to make complex structures. Global mechanical properties can be tuned based on sub-part ordering and geometry, because local stiffness and density can be independently set to a wide range of values and varied spatially. The structure's intrinsic modularity can significantly simplify analysis and simulation.

A multi-disciplinary design methodology is used to optimally generate the compliant structure with the aim of maximising the produced rolling moment, while minimising mass and drag. The design tool considers the three-dimensional, aeroelastic behaviour and structural constraints. In particular, a parametric metamodel is used to identify the best morphing skin design. The results show that the wing can achieve high levels of control authority and has a lower or equivalent weight compared to conventional wings. A wing demonstrator is manufactured and its aeroelastic performance is tested. The measurements of the displacement field show an appreciable deformation without shape discontinuities. Low-speed wind tunnel tests indicate that the designed wing can produce roll moments that are sufficient for replacing conventional ailerons. Moreover, the obtained changes in shape have a negligible effect on the zero-lift drag, thus demonstrating the aerodynamic efficiency of profile changes achieved through morphing. An effective solution for covering the used corrugation while allowing for shape changes is also introduced and tested.},

The partially-active surface is designed to have sufficient bending stiffness in the chordwise direction to sustain chordwise shape under aerodynamic loading. In contrast, the in-plane stiffness is relatively high. however the necessary deformations that are required to change the aerodynamic response can still be attained while maintaining the surface perimeter constant. Coupled with two carefully selected boundary conditions, the proposed piezocomposite airfoil can achieve significant change in aerodynamic response. The surface geometry properties are determined using a Genetic Algorithm optimization method. The optimization is conducted to achieve maximum change of lift-output-per-square-root-of- drag which is the difference in the aerodynamic response for the airfoil at maximum excitation (asymmetric) and zero excitation (symmetric). A coupled analysis of the fluid- structure interaction is employed assuming static-aeroelastic behavior which allows the realization of a design that can sustain aerodynamic loads. The theoretical response is supplemented with extensive bench top and wind tunnel experiments on a representative prototype. The experimental results are compared to the theoretical predictions, highlighting agreements and discrepancies.},

Belt-rib airfoils are shape-adaptable lightweight structures based on this idea. A belt-rib structure originally consists of a deformable closed shell (belt) whose kinematic degrees of freedom are constrained by inner stiffeners called spokes. Using standard spoke elements, the possible profile changes of the airfoil are limited. The purpose of the work reported in the current article is to define an inner stiffening structure based on numerical topology optimization in order to realize arbitrary profile changes. A ground structure with moveable connection points within the external belt represents the set of possible topologies and shapes. A new modal objective function for the synthesis of compliant mechanisms with selective compliance is introduced. The optimization problem is approached by using genetic algorithms. The applicability of the current procedure is validated by a profile shape adaptation example. For this purpose, an initial profile shape and a target profile shape are defined. The outcome of the procedure is a complex inner stiffening structure, which fulfils the imposed requirements. The solution is validated by modal analysis based on an finite-element model. Furthermore, the structural behaviour is experimentally investigated. {\textcopyright} Authors 2010.},

  abstract  = {Morphing, understood as the ability to undergo pronounced shape adaptations to optimally respond to a diversity of operational conditions, has been singled out as a future direction in the pursuit of maximised efficiency of lightweight structures. Whereas a certain degree of adaptivity can be accomplished conventionally by means of mechanical systems, compliance allowing for substantial reversible deformability exhibits far more potential as a morphing strategy. A promising solution to the inherent contradiction between high stiffness and reversible deformation capacity posed by morphing is offered by introducing variable stiffness components. This notion indicates the provision of a controllable range of deformation resistance levels in place of fixed properties, as required by real-time shape adaptation dictated by maximum efficiency under changing external conditions. With special emphasis on the morphing context, the current review aims to identify the main tendencies, undertaking a systematic classification of existing approaches involving stiffness variability. Four broad categories in which variable stiffness has been applied to morphing are therefore distinguished and detailed: material engineering, active mechanical design, semi-active techniques and elastic structural behaviour. Adopting a wide perspective, the study highlights key capabilities, limitations and challenges. The need for attention directed to the variable stiffness strategy is recognised and the significance of intensive research activities in a highly integrated and multidisciplinary environment emphasised if higher maturity stages of the concepts are to be reached. Finally, the potential of emerging directions of semi-active design involving electro-bonded laminates and multi-stable structures is brought into focus. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The early breed of slow commercial airliners did not require high-lift systems because their wing loadings were low and their speed ratios between cruise and low speed (takeoff and landing) were about 2:1. However, even in those days the benefit of high-lift devices was recognized. Simple trailing-edge flaps were in use, not so much to reduce landing speeds, but to provide better glide-slope control without sideslipping the airplane and to improve pilot vision over the nose by reducing attitude during low-speed flight. As commercial-airplane cruise speeds increased with the development of more powerful engines, wing loadings increased and a real need for high-lift devices emerged to keep takeoff and landing speeds within reasonable limits. The high-lift devices of that era were generally trailing-edge flaps. When jet engines matured sufficiently in military service and were introduced commercially, airplane speed capability had to be increased to best take advantage of jet engine characteristics. This speed increase was accomplished by introducing the wing sweep and by further increasing wing loading. Whereas increased wing loading called for higher lift coefficients at low speeds, wing sweep actually decreased wing lift at low speeds. Takeoff and landing speeds increased on early jet airplanes, and, as a consequence, runways worldwide had to be lengthened. There are economical limits to the length of runways. there are safety limits to takeoff and landing speeds and there are speed limits for tires. So, in order to hold takeoff and landing speeds within reasonable limits, more powerful high-lift devices were required. Wing trailing-edge devices evolved from plain flaps to Fowler flaps with single, double, and even triple slots. Wing leading edges evolved from fixed leading edges to a simple Krueger flap, and from fixed, slotted leading edges to two- and three-position slats and variable-camber (VC) Krueger flaps. The complexity of high-lift systems probably peaked on the Boeing 747, which has a VC Krueger flap and triple-slotted, inboard and outboard trailing-edge flaps. Since then, the tendency in high-lift system development has been to achieve high levels of lift with simpler devices in order to reduce fleet acquisition and maintenance costs. The intent of this paper is to: (1) review available high-lift devices, their functions, and design criteria (2) appraise high-lift systems presently in service on commercial air liners (3) present personal study results on high-lift systems (4) develop a weight and cost model for high-lift systems and (5) discuss the development tendencies of future high-lift systems.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a compliant morphing flap transition that seeks to address a long-standing source of noise and drag in the design of aircraft wings – the gap present at the spanwise ends of the control surfaces. These gaps create large discontinuities in the flow and allow for pressure leakage from the lower to upper wing surface, generating significant amounts of vorticity, noise, and drag. The concept introduced here seals this gap with a smooth, three-dimensional morphing transition section that elastically lofts between the rigid wing and moving control surface in a passive and continuous manner. Previous transition concepts are first discussed, followed by establishment of an initial desired transition shape. Computational fluid dynamics analysis of the desired transition shape indicates both an increase in lift and a decrease in drag. The morphing, elastically lofted transition concept proposed here will then be introduced. In this concept, the complex three-dimensional shape change required is created with a novel structural architecture that combines material and geometric compliance with geometric bend-twist coupling. The concept design and operating principles will be introduced, relevant geometric parameters will be derived, and an initial prototype demonstrator capable of large deflections and smooth transition surfaces will be shown.},

Axial compressive stiffness and bending stiffness at various temperatures (-60 degrees C similar to 20 degrees C) and vessel pressures (1MPa similar to 8MPa) were studied. Results show that the axial compressive stiffness and bending stiffness of joint-SR1 remain stable throughout the temperature range of -60 degrees C similar to 20 degrees C, while those remain stable throughout the temperature range of -40 degrees C similar to 20 degrees C and become to be infinite at -50 degrees C due to the elastic failure of elastomer material for the joint-SR2. Analysis indicates that the reason that elastomer of joint-SR2 lost elasticity at -50 degrees C is not glass-transition but crystallization. The phenomenon of elastic failure did not appear throughout the temperature range -60 degrees C similar to 20 degrees C for the joint-SR1 elastomer is due to the existence of phenyl side-group substitute. The modified chain content of silicone rubber not only affects the process of crystallization inhibition but also the crystallization rate. The rubber with phenyl or other bulky side-group could destroy the crystal of silicone rubber at low temperatures, which is beneficial to be applied in small-size flexible joint},

  abstract = {The use of `compliant' or flexible mechanisms constitutes a very promising option for the successful realization of shape-adaptable airfoil structures. Achieving large deformations by exploiting structural flexibility instead of employing conventional mechanisms with moveable parts offers several advantages: absence of backlash and wear, no need for lubrication, reduced noise, smooth geometry changes, a lighter design, and reduced manufacturing costs. As a counterpart, compliant systems are more complex to analyze and design due to their inherent coupled behavior. Established design procedures, developed in the framework of kinematics design, are of limited use for application to shape-adaptable structures due to differences in requirement priorities. This study presents a novel synthesis procedure for compliant shape-adaptable airfoils. Initially devised for the so-called belt-rib airfoils, the procedure can be extended to the general case of compliant airfoils with an external flexible skin (optionally reinforced by frames) and a system of internal stiffeners. After the description of the core synthesis algorithm, which is based on a modal approach, its integration in a global design procedure is discussed. Application to the case of a belt-rib airfoil is then considered. The compliant structure resulting from the procedure combines the characteristic qualities of a compliant system (smooth deformation pattern, absence of moveable parts, low weight) with the low load-dependence of kinematics which is typical of conventional mechanisms.},

Shape memory polymer skins undergo large strain in their flexible, rubbery state and resist aerodynamic loads in their stiff, glassy state. However, pure shape memory polymers are brittle in their glassy state, and in their rubbery state, they tear rapidly along micro-cracks formed under tension. Due to these disadvantages, the shape memory poly-mers are not safe and reliable enough for application. In this article, elastic fibers were mixed into pure shape memory polymers to solve these problems. The mechanical properties of the shape memory polymer composites were investi-gated. The strength and Young's modulus of pure shape memory polymers at high temperature were improved by elastic fibers, and the toughness of pure shape memory polymers at room temperature (glassy state) was enhanced with accep-table reduction in Young's modulus. The tear strength of shape memory polymers was significantly improved by elastic fibers, especially at high temperature. Recovery properties and thermal performance were also discussed. Finally, shape memory polymer composite skins were used in a variable camber wing structure to demonstrate their application.},

The work centers on creating variable stiffness composite materials which exhibit a controllable change in elastic modulus (bending or axial) and large reversible strains (5-15{\%}). We have performed a simulation study to better understand the implication of various geometric design parameters on the elastic and deformation behavior. Using this information, a series of prototype materials were prepared using a commercial shape memory polymer, and measurements on these materials indicate a controllable change in stiffness as a function of temperature with large reversible strain accommodation. We have fabricated and tested several design variations of laminar morphing materials which exhibit structural stiffness values of 8-12 GPa, changes in modulus of 15-77x and large reversible axial of 2-10{\%}. Results indicate that significant controllable changes in stiffness are possible. Further, agreement between simulations and prototype material properties indicate that simulations may be used an effective screening tool to specify micromechanical design variations for specific application requirements.},

These insights can be used to guide actuator design, thus accelerating the design process. Here, we study fluid-powered fiber-reinforced actuators, because these have previously been shown to be capable of producing a wide range of motions. We present a design strategy that takes a kinematic trajectory as its input and uses analytical modeling based on nonlinear elasticity and optimization to identify the optimal design parameters for an actuator that will follow this trajectory upon pressurization.

  abstract = {Aircraft wings are a compromise that allows the aircraft to fly at$\backslash$na range of flight conditions, but the performance at each condition$\backslash$nis sub-optimal. The ability of a wing surface to change its geometry$\backslash$nduring flight has interested researchers and designers over the years$\backslash$nas this reduces the design compromises required. Morphing is the$\backslash$nshort form for metamorphose. however, there is neither an exact definition$\backslash$nnor an agreement between the researchers about the type or the extent$\backslash$nof the geometrical changes necessary to qualify an aircraft for the$\backslash$ntitle {\^{a}}€˜shape morphing.{\^{a}}€™ Geometrical parameters that can be affected$\backslash$nby morphing solutions can be categorized into: planform alteration$\backslash$n(span, sweep, and chord), out-of-plane transformation (twist, dihedral/gull,$\backslash$nand span-wise bending), and airfoil adjustment (camber and thickness).$\backslash$nChanging the wing shape or geometry is not new. Historically, morphing$\backslash$nsolutions always led to penalties in terms of cost, complexity, or$\backslash$nweight, although in certain circumstances, these were overcome by$\backslash$nsystem-level benefits. The current trend for highly efficient and$\backslash$n{\^{a}}€˜green{\^{a}}€™ aircraft makes such compromises less acceptable, calling$\backslash$nfor innovative morphing designs able to provide more benefits and$\backslash$nfewer drawbacks. Recent developments in {\^{a}}€˜smart{\^{a}}€™ materials may$\backslash$novercome the limitations and enhance the benefits from existing design$\backslash$nsolutions. The challenge is to design a structure that is capable$\backslash$nof withstanding the prescribed loads, but is also able to change$\backslash$nits shape: ideally, there should be no distinction between the structure$\backslash$nand the actuation system. The blending of morphing and smart structures$\backslash$nin an integrated approach requires multi-disciplinary thinking from$\backslash$nthe early development, which significantly increases the overall$\backslash$ncomplexity, even at the preliminary design stage. Morphing is a promising$\backslash$nenabling technology for the future, next-generation aircraft. However,$\backslash$nmanufacturers and end users are still too skeptical of the benefits$\backslash$nto adopt morphing in the near future.

  abstract = {The design of morphing wings involves the disciplines of aerodynamics and structural mechanics. the aero-structural coupling is of chief importance in case smart materials are used as distributed actuators. Considering these specific requirements, this paper presents an approach to optimize concurrently the variables describing the wing external shape, the internal compliant structure, and the embedded actuators. An aeroelastic analysis tool is developed to simulate the response of distributed compliance three-dimensional wings, considering the activation of the smart materials. A method to formulate the optimization requirements based on the aircraft mission is presented, using the aerodynamic performance from the aeroelastic study in the optimization goal. To prove the validity and the computational feasibility of this methodology, a morphing wing for a 3-m-wingspan radio-controlled plane is optimized. A structural concept actuated by single crystal Macro Fiber Composites and dielectric elastomers is introduced, and its compliant structure is parameterized using a novel compact Voronoi-based representation. The optimized wing design produces rolling moments sufficient to guarantee the controllability of the flight. Numerical evaluation of the aerodynamic efficiency shows that an optimal activation of the embedded actuators further increases the advantages of morphing outside the design condition with respect to rigid wings.

Some of these applications suggest that materials with low in-plane stiffness and relatively high out-of-plane stiffness may be required. To this end, a two-step design process has been developed in order to synthesize skins to meet these requirements. The first step in the process is to determine bulk material properties for the skin and the layout of attachments between the skin and underlying substructure. This results in a distribution of bulk properties across the skin. The second step utilizes these property values as constraints to match the found bulk property in a multi-phase material optimization in order to determine the layout of a set of microscopic multi-phase material unit cells. As a first attempt, a 2D engineered skin design using a proposed two-step process is demonstrated in this article, and material fabrication process using a rapid prototyping (RP) technique and test result are discussed.},

Thanks to its simplicity, the compliant belt-rib concept is regarded by the authors as a promising solution. Using the compliant rib designed by Hasse and Campanile as a starting point, a compliant morphing wing made of composite materials is designed. Innovative methods for optimal placing of the actuation and for the quantification of the morphing are used. The performance of the compliant morphing wing in terms of three-dimensional (3D) structural behaviour and aerodynamic properties, both two-and three-dimensional, is presented and discussed. The fundamental importance of considering 3D coupling effects in the determination of the performance of morphing aerofoils is shown. (Some figures may appear in colour only in the online journal)},

  abstract = {Chord extension morphing of helicopter rotors has recently been shown to be highly beneficial for stall alleviation, with the ability to reduce power near the envelope boundaries and increase maximum gross weight, altitude, and speed capability of the aircraft. This article presents a morphing mechanism to extend the chord of a section of the helicopter rotor blade. The region aft of the leading-edge spar contains a morphing cellular structure. In the compact state, the edge of the cellular structure aligns with the trailing edge of the rest of the blade. When the morphing cellular structure is in the extended state, the chord of that section of the blade is increased by 30{\%}. In transitioning from compact to extended states, the cellular structure slides along the ribs which define the boundaries of the morphing section in the spanwise direction. The cellular section has mini-spars running along the spanwise direc-tion to attach the flexible skin and provide stiffness against camber-like deformations due to aerodynamic loads. This article presents a finite element analysis and design of the morphing cellular structure, ensuring that the local strains in the elastic ligaments of the cellular structure do not exceed the maximum allowable, even as the section undergoes a large global strain. The morphing cellular structure itself is designed to be stiff enough to support the pre-stretched skin attached to its surfaces. Various methods of flexible skin attachment to the morphing substructure, and their ramifications, are considered. A model of a blade section is fabricated and shown to undergo chord morphing, as designed.},

Such structures are of interest for a number of applications. This article presents the new solution of adaptive shape morphing compliant structure with embedded actuators that is capable of changing its shape on demand to meet various performance requirements: the physical prototype of this structure is manufactured. Upgraded approach to the synthesis of compliant mechanisms with embedded actuators is also presented. The existing design methodology for simultaneous synthesis of compliant mechanism and actuator placement often produces compliant system with intersecting structural elements as well as actuators which is very difficult to manufacture. Thus, the design methodology is improved so that compliant systems are obtained without intersecting elements. The scalability of the shape morphing compliant structure is investigated as well. Two possible applications of the novel developed shape morphing structure are presented, for adaptive compliant gripper and shape morphing wing that resembles the profile of a bird wing.},

  abstract = {For a significant improvement in the fuel efficiency of long-range transport aircraft, a transition to blended-wing-body (BWB) configurations will be required in the long term. Further efficiency improvements are expected from an all-composite primary structure, all-electric actuation, as well as from seamless control surfaces that provide reduced drag compared to conventional control surfaces. BWB configurations feature specific demands on the control system because of the high coupling between flap deflections and aircraft movements in all three axes. Thus, multi-objective control surfaces are required for flight control, as well as for active gust and manoeuvre load alleviation. A major challenge therefore is to provide sufficient yaw control and stability in the absence of a vertical tail. Generally, one engine inoperative poses an important sizing case for the control system design, especially for the control surfaces. In this article, the sizing of winglet flaps and crocodile flaps is performed for the preliminary design of an all-composite, all-electric BWB airliner. For further improvement in efficiency, a seamless morphing trailing edge device is designed that provides both crocodile flap and aileron modes at the same time. Based on these results, a composite morphing trailing edge demonstrator with an all-electric actuation system is investigated. Some open issues remain for investigation. Still, the proposed design provides a promising approach for further efficiency improvement on BWB aircraft configurations.},

The optimization procedure is described as well as the structural model. The aerodynamic shape optimization code, that uses a viscous two-dimensional panel method formulation coupled with a nonlinear lifting-line algorithm and a sequential quadratic programming optimization algorithm, is suitable for preliminary wing design optimization tasks. The morphing concept, based on changes in wing-planform shape and wing-section shape achieved by extending spars and telescopic ribs, is explained in detail. Comparisons between optimized fixed wing performance, optimal morphing wing performance, and the performance of the wing obtained from the coupled aerodynamic- structural solution are presented. Estimates for the performance enhancements achieved by the unmanned aerial vehicles when fitted with this new morphing wing are also presented.

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. This paper presents the design, optimization, realization and testing of a novel wing morphing concept, based on distributed compliance structures, and actuated by piezoelectric elements. The adaptive wing features ribs with a selectively compliant inner structure, numerically optimized to achieve aerodynamically efficient shape changes while simultaneously withstanding aeroelastic loads. The static and dynamic aeroelastic behavior of the wing, and the effect of activating the actuators, is assessed by means of coupled 3D aerodynamic and structural simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed morphing concept and optimization procedure, the wings of a model airplane are designed and manufactured according to the presented approach. The goal is to replace conventional ailerons, thus to achieve controllability in roll purely by morphing. The mechanical properties of the manufactured components are characterized experimentally, and used to create a refined and correlated finite element model. The overall stiffness, strength, and actuation capabilities are experimentally tested and successfully compared with the numerical prediction. To counteract the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of the piezoelectric actuators, a closed-loop controller is implemented, and its capability of accurately achieving the desired shape adaptation is evaluated experimentally. Using the correlated finite element model, the aeroelastic behavior of the manufactured wing is simulated, showing that the morphing concept can provide sufficient roll authority to allow controllability of the flight. The additional degrees of freedom offered by morphing can be also used to vary the plane lift coefficient, similarly to conventional flaps. The efficiency improvements offered by this technique are evaluated numerically, and compared to the performance of a rigid wing.},

  abstract  = {Morphing technology on aircrafts has found increased interest over the last decade because it is likely to enhance performance and efficiency over a wider range of flight conditions. The key technologies in morphing aircrafts include adaptive structures, deformable smart skin, driving actuators, flight dynamics and flight control. Among them, the deformable smart skin and light-weight driving actuators have been the main obstacles to the real-world implementation of the morphing aircraft. The difficulties in the smart skin rest on the contradiction between its ability to resist aerodynamic load in the normal direction and the in-plane flexibility for morphing functions. This contradiction cannot be solved by using sophisticated properties of the skin materials. It can only be solved by new skin structures, which give anisotropic stiffness for bending and in-plane deformation. In this article two skin structures for morphing aircrafts, the wavy skin structure and the honeycomb skin structure, are introduced. The actuators for morphing aircrafts are required to have large stroke, large output force, good compactness, and good controllability. In this article, piezoelectric-hydraulic actuators are introduced. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier.},

Thus, the area of the FCS can be changed significantly. Geometrical equations are established for describing the extensional deformation of the FCS. Based on equilibrium equations and laminate theory, analytical solutions are derived for calculating the mechanical properties of the FCS in an extensional deformation process. In order to validate the FCS design and the analytical model, FCS specimens made from T300/5228 prepreg were fabricated using vacuum bag and co-bonding methods. Tensile tests on the FCS specimens were successfully carried out. Load versus displacement curves, tensile stiffness versus tensile load curves and relative deformation versus tensile load curves were measured. Comparisons between the theoretical predictions and the experiments were conducted. It is shown that the predictions using the new model correlates well with the experiments. The theoretical analysis and experimental validation thus show that the new FCS design was effective and feasible.},

The droop nose is an essential component of a novel internally blown high-lift system for a transport aircraft to delay stall and reduce internal compressor requirements. A design chain consisting of optimization procedures was used to arrive at the structural design of the droop nose composed of a composite fiberglass skin with integral stringers and supporting kinematic mechanisms. The optimization tools aim to produce a design with minimal error to the critical target shapes. A maximum final error of 10.09?mm between calculated and target trajectories of the stringers was found after the kinematic optimization stage. After inputting the kinematic optimization results into the skin optimization stage and solving, a maximum error in the order of 13?mm and curvature difference 0.0028?1/mm were calculated, occurring in the outboard region. Prior two-dimensional analyses with similar shape deviations showed 0.4{\%} lift reduction though further three-dimensional investigations are required. Concepts for integrating industrial requirements abrasion and lightning strike protection and in-flight de-icing into a multifunctional skin show promise and the resulting aerodynamic surface quality was found to be adequate.},

This paper presents a camber morphing technique for wing structures relying on chiral topologies with tunable stiffness. The unique cellular pattern of the proposed chiral structure leads to a large tailorability of the highly nonlinear mechanical response, while simultaneously allowing for high deformability under global planar deformations. These characteristics are exploited to design selectively compliant wing ribs to achieve a reversible chordwise shape adaptation mechanism. The morphing capabilities of wing structures using the proposed chiral honeycomb as compliant ribs are assessed by means of finite elements calculations. The resulting wing design enables unique mechanical responses, such as large zero–stiffness phases. With the potential to drastically reduce the actuation requirements, these can be beneficially exploited for morphing techniques relying on active methods. Purely passive shape adaptation can benefit from the eminent deformation–dependent stiffness variation, showing potential to be successfully implemented for load alleviation purposes. Techniques to further augment the design space of the proposed structural concept are introduced, allowing for even greater tailorability of the resulting mechanical response, and therefore extending the applicability of this technique for shape adaptation applications.},

Road vehicle aerodynamic design is primarily concerned with reduction in the drag and generation of a downforce. Current trends in both aircraft and wind turbine blade design show significant interest in shape-adaptive (morphing) advanced structural concepts for improved aerodynamic performance or the realization of new functionality. Morphing structures are also of interest because they have the potential to create designs of simple construction and reduced mass. However, there is an inherent contradiction between the need to create compliant structures to keep actuator demands low and the requirement for designing stiff load-carrying structures. This highlights the key design challenge for morphing structures. Ways of addressing these conflicting demands include the use of advanced composite materials which have extremely anisotropic stiffness properties or multistable behaviour. This review provides a perspective on recent developments in research on morphing structures and the potential applications for these emerging technologies in automobile aerodynamic design.},

  abstract  = {In this study, one kind of developed morphing skin embedded with pneumatic muscle fibers (PMFs) was manufactured and was employed for camber morphing structures. The output force and contraction of PMF as well as the morphing skin were experimentally characterized at a series of discrete actuator pressures varying from 0.15 to 0.35 MPa. The active morphing skin test results show that the output force is 73.59 N and the contraction is 0.097 (9.7{\%}) at 0.35 MPa. Due to these properties, this active morphing skin could be easily used for the morphing structures. Then the proper airfoil profile was chosen to manufacture the adaptive airfoil in this study. The chord-wise bending airfoil structure was achieved by employing this kind of active morphing skin. Finally the deformed shapes of this chord-wise bending airfoil structure were obtained by 3-dimensions scanning measurement. Meanwhile the camber morphing structures were analyzed through the finite element method (FEM) and the deformed shapes of the upper surface skins were obtained. The experimental result and FEM analysis result of deformed shapes of the upper surface skins were compared in this paper.},

Utilizing spatially variable stiffness materials in morphing structures leads to a possible reduction in the actuation energy requirement and also enables geometric control over the deformed shape of the morphing structure, resulting in enhanced aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance. In this study, a design optimization methodology has been developed to identify the required material stiffness variations of a morphing structure for target optimal deformed shapes. In the optimization scheme, a layer-wise sandwich beam model is used to predict the structural behaviour of the flap with a specific material stiffness variation. Two-dimensional fluid/ structure static aeroelastic interaction analysis is performed in the design optimization. Finite element analysis and mechanical tests were also carried out for a chosen optimization result to study the actuation requirements and the capability of control over the deformed shape of the morphing trailing edge. Numerical and experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed optimization methodology for identifying the required stiffness variation in the core and also ways of using rapid prototyped honeycomb core to realize the honeycomb core stiffness variations are discussed.},

  abstract   = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. The aerodynamic performance of wing structures is directly related to their external geometry. The idea of seamless shape adaptation of the wing geometry (or morphing) has emerged to provide the capability of operating optimally in a wide range of conditions. Of particular importance to realize the potential of morphing is the ability of the wing skin to conform to the different geometrical contours. Several concepts for morphing skins have been presented to address this design challenge, each presenting peculiar strengths and weaknesses depending on the chosen combination of material and structural arrangement. This paper investigates the generic structural properties of a passive morphing skin design to allow for optimal shape adaptation through cambering. The properties of the morphing skin are included among the design variables to identify their optimal value. multi-objective optimizations are used to obtain parametric results. The results indicate the need for a high anisotropy, both between membrane and bending properties and between the skin's principal directions. The impact of the skin weight on the wing design is also shown.},

The overall properties of the flexible skins are mainly determined by the cell structure types and parameters. The in-plane mechanical properties of three different zero-Poisson cell structures were investigated with analytical, numerical and experimental methods to determine the most suitable cell structure for two-dimensional morphing. The geometric and material nonlinearity effects on the in-plane mechanical properties of the cell structures were also discussed. The material constants of a silicone rubber as flexible face sheet were then experimentally determined and its hyperelastic behaviors were simulated to find a better boundary condition in which uniform strain and larger global strain could be obtained. 98.6{\%} global strain for span morphing and 9.2° angle change for sweep morphing were achieved in the simulation tests of integrated skin, which validates the two-dimensional morphing capacity of the passive sandwiched skin proposed in this article. For the actuation requirement of the passive skin, a shape memory alloy (SMA) based antagonistic actuator for span morphing was developed and tested. With 11.5{\%} global strain finally achieved, the results, to certain extent, validates the feasibility of SMA actuator application to wing span morphing.},

Several types of finite element models for these spiral structures using laminated plate elements, beam elements and solid elements with contact were then developed and compared at a range of angles. The beam and solid element models provide the best approximation and indicate that a 30°/45° fiber structure is a good angle combination to not only provide significant radial expansion but also show a relatively low stress. Several polymeric specimens were 3D-printed and tested under tension. Testing confirmed that the spiral fiber systems exhibited auxetic behavior. The polymeric specimens exhibited more radial expansion than the finite element predictions. Thus, spiral fiber bundles show promise and will be explored further.},

The considered structures consist of two curved shells that are joined in a specific manner to form a bistable airfoil-like structure. The two stable shapes have a difference in axial twist, and the structure may be transformed between the stable shapes by a simple snap-through action. The benefit of a bistable structure of this type is that, if the stable shapes are operational shapes, power is needed only to transform the structure from one shape to another. The discussed structures could be used in aerodynamic applications such as morphing wings, or as aerodynamic control surfaces. The investigation discussed in this paper considers both experiment and finite-element analysis. Several graphite-epoxy composite and one steel device were created as proof-of-concept models. To demonstrate active control of these structures, piezocomposite actuators were applied to one of the composite structures and used to transform the structure between stable shapes. The analysis was used to compare the predicted shapes with the experimental shapes, and to study how changes to the geometric input values affected the shape and operational characteristics of the structures. The predicted shapes showed excellent agreement with the experimental shapes, and the results of the parametric study suggest that the shapes and the snap-through characteristics can be easily tailored to meet specific needs.},

However, just as advanced composites offer numerous benefits over traditional engineering materials for structural design, actuators that utilize the active properties of piezoelectric fibers can improve upon many of the limitations encountered when using monolithic piezoceramic devices. Several new piezoelectric fiber composites have been developed, however almost all studies have implemented these devices such that they are surface-bonded patches used for sensing or actuation. This paper will introduce a novel active piezoelectric structural fiber that can be laid up in a composite material to perform sensing and actuation, in addition to providing load bearing functionality. The sensing and actuation aspects of this multifunctional material will allow composites to be designed with numerous embedded functions including, structural health monitoring, power generation, vibration sensing and control, damping, and shape control through anisotropic actuation. A one-dimensional micromechanics model of the piezoelectric fiber will be developed to characterize the feasibility of constructing structural composite lamina with high piezoelectric coupling. The theoretical model will be validated through finite element (FE) modeling in ABAQUS. The results will show that the electromechanical coupling of a fiber-reinforced polymer composite incorporating the active structural fiber (ASF) could be more than 70{\%} of the active constituent. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The composite is composed of a mechanically-prestressed layer, a fluidic layer, and a constraining layer. The composite can be driven to any desired shape up to a flat limiting shape through modulation of pressure in its fluidic layer. An analytical model is developed to characterize the quasi-static response of such a composite to the applied fluid pressure for various laminate stacking sequences. A parametric study is also conducted to study the effects of the dimensions of the fluid channel and its spatial location. Composite beams are fabricated in the laminate configuration that requires the least actuation effort for a given change in curvature.

Structural functions include mechanical properties like strength, stiffness, fracture toughness, and damping, while non-structural functions include electrical and/or thermal conductivity, sensing and actuation, energy harvesting/storage, self-healing capability, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, recyclability and biodegradability.

  abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) seeks to provide ongoing monitoring of a structure's integrity. Current SHM approaches include embedding some type of sensor within the composite or applying a sensor to the outside surface of the structure. These sensors react to strain or other changes in order to detect damage. In this study, a novel, multi-modal, nanomaterial based sensor technology that can provide wide area detection of damage was used. The efforts presented here serve as a feasibility study into the incorporation of carbon nanomaterials into structural composites as sensors. The carbon nanotube (CNT) covered fiber (fuzzy fiber) sensors exhibit similar sensitivity to conventional strain gages and are more easily integrated into composite structures as the sensor itself is a composite. The fuzzy fiber strain gages can be used to sense strain within composite structures and can be readily integrated into the structural laminate to provide sensing over large sections and in previously inaccessible locations. The unique properties of the fuzzy fiber lends itself to application in a wide range of sensing tasks within a structural composite including strain, temperature, degradation, etc. The fuzzy fiber may be tailored so that the same basic sensor can be used for a multitude of sensing applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The most popular methodologies employed to manufacture composite components still lack sufficient rate to meet demand. Furthermore, the state of the art in automated processes imposes restrictions on component geometrical complexity. Many of these restrictions arise directly as a result of the use of continuous fibre reinforcements. Pro- cessing and use of highly-aligned discontinuous fibres may avoid many of the manu- facturing defects induced in continuous fibre architectures, which are a result of design decisions and manipulations during processing operations, while theoretically allow- ing for similar mechanical properties if alignment and orientation are tightly controlled. An overview of the history of aligned short fibre composites has been presented, with the focus upon process and application of highly aligned advanced composites with properties near to that of continuous fibre composites. When continuous carbon fibres were first developed, there remained an interest to create aligned discontinuous fibre composites in order to form more complex components. This interest has reappeared in recent years with methods divided into those which align short fibres and those which introduce discontinuities into aligned fibres. It is clear that discontinuous material sys- tems have their uses and applications, but greater development is still required in or- der to better quantify and categorise the materials and their associated properties and processes.},

In this study, the corrugated composites manufactured from carbon fiber plain woven fabrics draw attention as a candidate material for flexible structural components, e.g. morphing wings. In-plane stiffness and strength of the original corrugated composites are evaluated through the tensile and bending tests in both in-plane longitudinal and transverse directions. A simple analytical model for the initial stiffness of the corrugated composites is developed, and the predictions are compared with the experimental results. Moreover, some improvements, installing of stiff rod and flexible rubber, are attempted for the creation of smooth aerodynamic surface and the improvement of stiffness. Mechanical properties of the modified corrugated composites are also evaluated and compared with those of the original corrugated composites. The applicability of the corrugated composites to the flexible wing structures are discussed based on the specific stiffness, longitudinal-to-transverse stiffness ratio, etc. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{campanile2000,
abstract = {The belt-rib concept for lifting surfaces with variable camber evolved at DLR recently as one of the most promising solutions for the adaptive wing. With the belt-rib idea the adaptive wing issue is approached in a new way: instead of a "mechatronic" solution with hinges or linear bearings a "structronic" solution is chosen, where distributed flexibility allows the desired shape changes. The resulting system is not only easier to maintain due to the absence of wear, but also is structurally more reliable and substantially lighter. The new concept evolves from the classical wing structure. The classical rib, which is in charge of the wing section's stiffness, is replaced by a "belt rib," which allows camber changes within given limits while leaving the remaining in-plane stiffness properties of the section widely unchanged. The evolution of the belt-rib concept was accompanied by experimental tests on different prototypes. After a first development stage, in which mainly the system's shape adaptability and the overall stiffness properties were investigated, further steps followed, focused on manufacturing, weight optimization and strength aspects. Recent developments dealt with the construction of a model with solid-state hinges, realized as hybrid glass fiber-carbon-fiber reinforced composite structure. The model is actuated mechanically by cables, which can be replaced by multifunctional actuators--like shape memory wires--in the future. The paper opens with an introduction about shape control of aerospace structures and variable camber in particular, in which the major advantages of a "structronic" approach with respect to classical solutions are discussed. Then the fundamentals of the belt-rib concept are sketched, with some significant results of the feasibility proof phase, followed by the description of the last developments. The conclusion summarizes the potential of a structronic approach to shape control with an outline of possible future work.},

  abstract = {Corrugation has long been seen as a simple and effective means of forming lightweight structures with high anisotropic behaviour, stability under buckling load and energy absorption capability. This has been exploited in diverse industrial applications and academic research. In recent years, there have been numerous innovative developments to corrugated structures, involving more elaborate and ingenious corrugation geometries and combination of corrugations with advanced materials. This development has been largely led by the research interest in morphing structures, which seek to exploit the extreme anisotropy of a corrugated panel, using the flexible degrees of freedom to allow a structure's shape to change, whilst bearing load in other degrees of freedom. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature on corrugated structures, with applications ranging from traditional engineering structures such as corrugated steel beams through to morphing aircraft wing structures. As such it provides an important reference for researchers to have a broad but succinct perception of the mechanical behaviour of these structures. Such a perception is highly required in the multidisciplinary design of corrugated structures for the application in morphing aircraft.},

This work presents the design of an elastomer coated composite corrugated skin for the camber morphing airfoil. The good in-plane strain capability and highly anisotropic behaviour of composite corrugated panels make them very effective in morphing wing applications. The behaviour of these corrugated skins must be investigated comprehensively and optimized in terms of aero-elastic effects and the boundary conditions arising from the internal wing structure. In this article, the geometric parameters of the coated composite corrugated panels are optimized to minimize the in-plane stiffness and the weight of the skin and to maximize the flexural out-of-plane stiffness of the corrugated skin. A finite element code for thin beam elements is used with the aggregate Newton?s method to optimize the geometric parameters of the coated corrugated panel. The advantages of the corrugated skin over the elastomer skin for the camber morphing structure are discussed. Moreover, a finite element simulation of the internal structure with the corrugated skin is performed under typical aerodynamic and structural loadings to check the design approach.},

abstract = {Compliant flap structure is already recognized as a device that can reduce or eliminate flow separation due to conventional flap system. It also has the ability to minimize drag and increase lift coefficient. However the manipulation of this compliant structure is not fully exploited for internal airfoil structure involving structural control deformation and flexibility. the main objective of this research is to design, fabricate, testing and quantify the aerodynamic and utilize the structural elasticity performance of a compliant mechanism airfoil for a high altitude and long endurance aircraft. The design is targeted to minimize the force required to morp surfaces while maintaining maximum stiffness to withstand external loading. A model of airfoil with embedded compliant mechanism has been develop and driven by servo motor and also tested on real fight testing. The aluminium and polymer composition are chosen to provide a smooth skin on the upper and the lower surface. The testing covered about the envelope expansion, natural laminar flow and high rate flap deflection. Through testing the author found that the wing produces more lift and afford to attach the laminar flow over 60{\%} on the airfoil surface when the flap was deflected. However the laminar boundary layer significantly increase another 10{\%} and able to generate lift when the flap system is activated by compliant mechanism. The success of high capability of embedded compliant mechanism shows the great potential in variable airfoil geometric capability. the adaptive compliant flap shows the capability and effectively control the upper and lower surface pressure distribution, minimize the flow separation and wing drag. The test measurement confirmed the extensive run of laminar flow on the airfoil and the flap was successfully operated in high altitude, low temperature environment without any operational restriction and limitation.},

abstract = {An interesting characteristic of avian gliders is their ability to soar or remain aloft without flapping their wings for long periods. There are two ways to do this. In static soaring a bird maintains or gains altitude by gliding in air that has an upward velocity component equal to or greater than the bird's sinking speed. In dynamic soaring a bird uses changes in the horizontal wind-velocity component to stay aloft, and no upward wind component is required. The ability of a bird to use either method depends on its aerodynamic characteristics and on atmospheric conditions},

This paper presents extensive experiments to study the effectiveness of the classification of Spanish opinions in five categories: highly positive, highly negative, positive, negative and neutral, using the combination of the psychological and linguistic features of LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count). LIWC is a text analysis software that enables the extraction of different psychological and linguistic features from natural language text. For this study, two corpora have been used, one about movies and one about technological products. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative assessment of the performance of various classification techniques, J48, SMO and BayesNet, using precision, recall and F-measure metrics. The findings revealed that the positive and negative categories provide better results than the other categories. Finally, experiments on both corpora indicated that SMO produces better results than BayesNet and J48 algorithms, obtaining an F-measure of 90.4 and 87.2{\%} in each domain.},

The model presented provides a better understanding of the parallax error. thus the accuracy of distance-related measurements could be improved when video-image systems are deployed.

  abstract  = {Lift and drag flight test data is presented from the National Flying Laboratory Centre, Jetstream 31 aircraft. The aircraft has been modified as a flying classroom for completing flight test training courses, for engineering degree accreditation. The straight and level flight test data is compared to data from 10{\%} and 17{\%} scale wind tunnel models, a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes steady-state computational fluid dynamics model and an empirical model. Estimated standard errors in the flight test data are ±2.4{\%} in lift coefficient, ±2.7{\%} in drag coefficient. The flight test data also shows the aircraft to have a maximum lift to drag ratio of 10.5 at Mach 0.32, a zero lift drag coefficient of 0.0376 and an induced drag correction factor of 0.0607. When comparing the characteristics from the other models, the best overall comparison with the flight test data, in terms of lift coefficient, was with the empirical model. For the drag comparisons, all the models under predicted levels of drag by up to 43{\%} when compared to the flight test data, with the best overall match between the flight test data and the 10{\%} scale wind tunnel model. These discrepancies were attributed to various factors including zero lift drag Reynolds number effects, omission of a propeller system and surface excrescences on the models, as well as surface finish differences.},

  abstract  = {Recent developments in morphing aircraft research have motivated investigation into conformal morphing systems, that is, shape change without discrete moving parts or abrupt changes in the airfoil profile. In this study, implementation of a continuous span morphing wing is described. The system consists of two primary components: (1) zero-Poisson ratio morphing core and (2) fiber-reinforced elastomeric matrix composite skin with a nearly zero-Poisson ratio in-plane. The main goal for improved air vehicle efficiency was a nominal 100{\%} change in area of the active wing section with less than 2.54 mm out-of-plane deflection under representative aerodynamic loading. Objectives of this study included exploring fabrication techniques for advanced morphing core shapes (i.e., having airfoil-shaped cross-section), exploiting customizable design parameters of in-house fabricated skin and core material, designing a prototype wing structure such that integration with a candidate UAV was feasible, and experimentally evaluating a laboratory prototype. As a result of this study, the ability to physically build and test a viable airfoil structure capable of increasing its planform area by 100{\%} (doubling span with constant chord) was demonstrated on a prototype hardware demonstration article. Satisfying objectives of designing, fabricating, and testing a prototype morphing wing section capable of 100{\%} span extension, while maintaining constant chord, a wind tunnel test highlighted the resulting viable aerodynamic surface in a wind tunnel test up to 130 km/h wind speeds. The prototype wing in its resting condition had a span of 61.0 cm, which could be extended to 122.0 cm, with less than 2.54 mm out-of-plane deflection in dynamic pressures consistent with the maximum speed, 130 km/h, of a candidate unmanned aerial vehicle platform. In meeting these goals, the morphing core was successfully transitioned from a simple 1D concept into a complex, cambered airfoil with sufficient free volume to house an actuation system. A refined elastomer matrix composite skin fabrication technique was also devised and experimentally validated on skins of various thicknesses and overall dimensions.},

  abstract  = {This article focuses on flexskins comprising of a cellular substructure and pretensioned facesheet for shear morphing applications. The unit cell of the substructure is a strand with some strain-relief feature, and it supports a segment of pretensioned facesheet. The function of the strain-relief feature is to reduce the peak strains in the strand and consequently the actuation work during shear morphing. Central hexagonal cells, elliptical cells, and half elliptical cells in the strand provided the sought strain relief at the edges of the strand, but the sharp corners and the proximity of these central features to those from adjacent strands during shear morphing led to a tendency for the facesheet to wrinkle. Alleviating wrinkling by increasing facesheet pretension increases the morphing actuation work requirement. Facesheet wrinkling can also be reduced by increasing strand separation, but this too requires higher prestrain in the facesheet to limit out-of-plane displacement under aerodynamic loads. The best solution was found to be the use of Gaussian- or Cosine-shaped curved strands which reduced morphing actuation force requirements by around 30{\%} compared to straight strands used on a previous demonstration aircraft, and the peak strain levels to about 1.2{\%} (down from 3.3{\%} for straight strands), while avoiding facesheet wrinkling. Going from a unit cell to a finite strip accounting for boundary effects it was observed that the curved strands near the rigid boundaries of the skin panel come very close to the boundaries at high morphing angles, promoting wrinkling in the facesheet. A gradient reduction in the amplitude of the curved section along the length of a strip of flexskin approaching the problematic boundary alleviates this situation. Other approaches examined prior to the adoption of the smooth curved strands, such as selective bonding of facesheet to the strands, varying the strand thickness, or offsetting the central strain relieving feature between successive strands, were unable to eliminate facesheet wrinkling at shear morphing angles.},

  abstract  = {A review of morphing concepts with a strong focus on morphing skins is presented. Morphing technology on aircraft has found increased interest over the last decade because it is likely to enhance performance and efficiency over a wider range of flight conditions. For example, a radical change in configuration, i.e. wing geometry in flight may improve overall flight performance when cruise and dash are important considerations. Although many morphing aircraft concepts have been elaborated only a few deal with the problems relating to a smooth and continuous cover that simultaneously deforms and carries loads. It is found that anisotropic and variable stiffness structures offer potential for shape change and small area increase on aircraft wings. Concepts herein focus on those structures where primary loads are transmitted in the spanwise direction and a morphing function is achieved via chordwise flexibility. To meet desirable shape changes, stiffnesses can either be tailored or actively controlled to guarantee flexibility in the chordwise (or spanwise) direction with tailored actuation forces. Hence, corrugated structures, segmented structures, reinforced elastomers or flexible matrix composite tubes embedded in a low modulus membrane are all possible structures for morphing skins. For large wing area changes a particularly attractive solution could adopt deployable structures as no internal stresses are generated when their surface area is increased.},

  abstract  = {Morphing aircraft wings require flexible skins that undergo large strains, have low in-plane stiffness, and high out-of-plane stiffness to carry aerodynamic loads. For some morphing applications deformation and low stiffness in the flexskin is required in one direction. In these cases, a flexible matrix composite (FMC) skin is proposed as a possible solution. A FMC comprises of stiff fibers embedded in a soft, high-strain capable matrix material. The matrix-dominated direction is aligned with the morphing direction. This allows the skin to undergo large strain at low energy cost. However, the high-stiffness in the fiber-dominated direction allows application of pretension along this direction, without rupture, and is critical for the membrane skin to carry out-of-plane pressure loads without excessive deformation. An analysis for a FMC skin panel is developed and validated against experiment. The analysis is used to conduct design studies. Comparison of the FMC skin to a matrix-only skin illustrates the importance of the fiber?s stiffness in tolerating pretension and limiting out-of-plane deformation under load. The other dominant parameter that limits out-of-plane deformation is panel size, with smaller lengths in the non-morphing direction proving beneficial. In general, fiber and matrix modulus has limited effect on out-of-plane deformation of flexskin panels.},

In this study, composites with curvilinear fiber paths are examined to enhance these conflicting structural requirements. The numerical results show that curved fiber paths can minimize the in-plane stiffness and increase the bending stiffness simultaneously compared to a baseline plate with straight fibers. A flexibility ratio is defined to assess the in-plane and out-of-plane deformation of the plate, simultaneously. A multi-objective optimization is formulated to find optimal curved fiber paths which maximize the flexibility ratio of the morphing wing skin. The optimization is performed with fiber paths represented as independent discrete fibers and continuous curvilinear fibers. The results show a significant increase in the flexibility ratio compared to a baseline plate with straight fibers. The aspect ratio of plate, laminate stacking sequence and in-plane loading direction have considerable influence on the optimal paths of the curved fibers. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The behaviour of these corrugated skins must be investigated comprehensively and optimized in terms of aero-elastic effects and the boundary conditions arising from the internal wing structure. In this article, the geometric parameters of the coated composite corrugated panels are optimized to minimize the in-plane stiffness and the weight of the skin and to maximize the flexural out-of-plane stiffness of the corrugated skin. A finite element code for thin beam elements is used with the aggregate Newton?s method to optimize the geometric parameters of the coated corrugated panel. The advantages of the corrugated skin over the elastomer skin for the camber morphing structure are discussed.

The skin of a morphing aircraft is a critical component. It must be compliant in degrees of freedom that are required for actuation, to minimise the actuation loads. However, it must also carry structural loads, and therefore be stiff in load bearing degrees of freedom. This leads to a requirement for extremely anisotropic material systems. A common solution is the use of a corrugated panel. However, previous work on corrugations has not addressed the problem of compressive buckling loads. This work analyses the performance of corrugated panels under buckling loads, and optimises corrugation patterns for the objectives of weight, buckling performance, and actuation compliance. Simplified analytical models that derive properties equivalent to conventional plates are used to obtain approximate estimates of the buckling loads. Furthermore a new mode of buckling, that occurs entirely in-plane and is unique to panels with extreme anisotropy is analysed. The simple models allow optimisation to be performed, and both a single-objective and a multi-objective approach are demonstrated. The results are compared to Finite Element Analysis.},

  abstract = {Extensive research is being devoted to the analysis and application of cellular solids for the design of innovative structural components. The chiral geometry in particular features a unique mechanical behavior which is here exploited for the design of 2D airfoils with morphing capabilities. A coupled-physics model, comprising computational fluid dynamics and structural analyses, investigates the influence of the chiral core on the aerodynamic behavior of the airfoil. Specifically, the model predicts the static deflection of the airfoil as a result of given flow conditions. The morphing capabilities of the airfoil, here quantified as camber changes, are evaluated for various design configurations of the core.},

The morphing wing with both leading edge and trailing edge morphing sections is proposed and the prototype model is designed by consideration of finite element structural analysis with actuation mechanisms and aerodynamic analysis. Through wind tunnel experiment with the manufactured prototype model, smooth actuation without harmful deformation under 20 m/s airflow is demonstrated. The observed deformation shape is well correlated with simulated shape by analysis. Thereby, the feasibility of the present morphing wing mechanism and design process are verified.},

  abstract = {An aircraft that has been carefully optimised for a single flight condition will tend to perform poorly at other flight conditions. For aircraft such as long-haul airliners, this is not necessarily a problem, since the cruise condition so heavily dominates a typical mission. However, other aircraft such as UAVs, may be expected to perform well at a wide range of flight conditions. Morphing systems may be a solution to this problem,as they allow the aircraft to adapt its shape to produce optimum performance at each flight condition. Optimisation of morphing aerofoils is typically performed separately to the morphing mechanism design. In this work, an optimisation strategy is developed to account for a known possible morphing system within the aerodynamic optimisation process itself. This allows for the limitations of the system to be considered from the start of the design process. The Fishbone Active Camber (FishBAC) camber morphing system is chosen as the example mechanism, and it is shown that the FishBAC can achieve large improvements in performance over non-morphing aerofoils when multiple flight conditions are considered. Additionally, its performance is compared to an aerofoil whose shape can change arbitrarily (as if a perfect morphing mechanism can be designed), and it is shown that the FishBAC performs nearly as well, despite being a relatively simple mechanism.},

  abstract  = {The effects of two geometric refinement strategies widespread in natural structures, chirality and self-similar hierarchy, on the in-plane elastic response of two-dimensional honeycombs were studied systematically. Simple closed-form expressions were derived for the elastic moduli of several chiral, anti-chiral, and hierarchical honeycombs with hexagon and square based networks. Finite element analysis was employed to validate the analytical estimates of the elastic moduli. The results were also compared with the numerical and experimental data available in the literature. We found that introducing a hierarchical refinement increases the Young's modulus of hexagon based honeycombs while decreases their shear modulus. For square based honeycombs, hierarchy increases the shear modulus while decreasing their Young's modulus. Introducing chirality was shown to always decrease the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the structure. However, chirality remains the only route to auxeticity. In particular, we found that anti-tetra-chiral structures were capable of simultaneously exhibiting anisotropy, auxeticity, and remarkably low shear modulus as the magnitude of the chirality of the unit cell increases.},

However, the conflict of requirements between compliance and stiffness, which is characteristic of shape-adaptable structures, often leads to compromise-driven solutions. This article presents the concept of a variable-camber airfoil with adjustable stiffness. Smart elements in the airfoil skin permit to adapt the structural rigidity to the system's operational states, resulting in more efficient morphing and potentially lighter designs. It is shown by a numerical study that with respect to a reference configuration, the actuation energy is reduced by up to 97{\%} and the structural mass can be lowered by up to two thirds. Furthermore, experiments on a scaled airfoil structure with a variable-stiffness skin based on electro-bonded laminates demonstrate effectivity and integrability of the proposed structural concept, which permit changes in cambering stiffness by a factor of at least 70.},

The approach described in this article starts from a requirement formulation based on a time-series of spanwise lift distributions on a morphing wing, representing the mission profile of the aircraft as a whole. This allows to specify goals based directly on aerodynamic performances instead of prescribing fixed geometrical shapes. Using the aero-structural analysis tool presented here, together with a parametrization representing the airfoil outer shape as well as its mechanical properties, allows the formulation of a combined aero-structural optimization problem. Promising aerodynamic and structural morphing performances have been obtained by applying the method to a morphing concept using Dielectric Elastomers (DEs) as actuators. Although the coupled physics are considered and a detailed material model has been used, results can be obtained within reasonable computational time by parallel evaluation of the candidate solutions. Improved aerodynamic performances have been obtained using this concurrent coupled method, in comparison to a sequential aerodynamic and structural optimization.},

Therefore, one may design structures with cellular materials while controlling stiffness and flexibility depending on the struts' connectivity. The objectives of this study are to investigate in-plane flexible properties of bending dominated cellular materials under macroscopic deformation and to secure a method to design a passive morphing airfoil with flexible cellular cores. The airfoil with three cellular cores (chiral, regular and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs) is investigated under a static load through the deformation gradient of the cellular cores under an aerostatic load. The structural performance of the airfoil with the designed compliant cellular cores is validated through the fluid-structure interaction through which a structural finite element analysis is combined with fluid statics. Considering the deformation of the airfoil with flexible cellular cores under an aerostatic load, shear is the dominant deformation mode of the cores of the airfoil. The re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb core shows the highest flexibility in shear and causes a lower stress in local cell walls in shear than the other cellular cores when the cellular mesostructures are designed to have the same shear modulus. This implies that the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb core has the potential to be used as a structure with a passive morphing airfoil. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose – Time demands faced by school principals make principals' work increasingly difficult. Research outside education suggests that effective time management skills may help principals meet job demands, reduce job stress, and improve their performance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate these hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach – The authors administered a time management inventory to nearly 300 principals in Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the fourth-largest school district in the USA. The authors analyzed scores on the inventory descriptively and used them to predict time-use data collected via in-person observations, a survey-based measure of job stress, and measures of perceived job effectiveness obtained from assistant principals and teachers in the school. Findings – Principals with better time management skills allocate more time in classrooms and to managing instruction in their schools but spend less time on interpersonal relationship-building. Perhaps as a result of this tradeoff, the authors find that associations between principal time management skills and subjective assessments of principal performance are mixed. The authors find strong evidence, however, that time management skills are associated with lower principal job stress. Practical implications – Findings suggest that building principals' time management capacities may be a worthwhile strategy for increasing time on high-priority tasks and reducing stress. Originality/value – This study is the first to empirically examine time management among school principals and link time management to key principal outcomes using large-scale data.},

Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1. Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. (See Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details about the specific language the IPCC uses to communicate uncertainty) The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in the Technical Summary.

  abstract  = {The purpose of this study is to develop tools dedicated to the design of sandwich panels involving Nomex honeycomb cores. Special attention is paid on the ability to perform full three dimensional calculations up to failure of such structures. In a first part, the determination of effective elastic properties of Nomex honeycomb cores is carried out thanks to strain based periodic homogenization technic. Using an equivalence in energy between a reel honeycomb and a fictious continuous medium, it becomes possible to evaluate the elastic behaviour of Nomex cores, starting from the knowledge of the behaviour of the constitutive paper. Next, relying on experimental observations, the strengths of Nomex honeycomb cores are evaluated with a linear Euler's buckling analysis. Results are compared with data coming from manufacturers, and give satisfaction. In order to carry out these two first studies, the NidaCore software has been developed using the finite element code Cast3M from CEA. Last part deals with the modeling of the nonlinear compressive response of Nomex cores. A model based on the thermodynamics of irreversible process is proposed and the identification technic detailed. Good agreement between experiemental data and computed values is obtained.},

  abstract    = {A crucial issue in the design of aircraft components is the evaluation of a larger number of potential design alternatives. This evaluation involves too expensive procedures, consequently, it slows down the search for optimal design samples. As a result, scarce or small number of design samples with high dimensional parameter space and high non-linearity pose issues in learning of surrogate models. Furthermore, surrogate models have more issues in handling qualitative data (discrete) than in handling quantitative data (continuous). These issues bring the need for investigations of methods of surrogate modelling for the most effective use of available data.   The thesis goal is to support engineers in the early design phase of development of new aircraft engines, specifically, a component of the engine known as Turbine Rear Structure (TRS). For this, tree-based approaches are explored for surrogate modelling for the purpose of exploration of larger search spaces and for speeding up the evaluations of design alternatives. First, we have investigated the performance of tree models on the design concepts of TRS. Second, we have presented an approach to explore design space using tree models, Random Forests. This approach includes hyperparameter tuning, extraction of parameters importance and if-then rules from surrogate models for a better understanding of the design problem. With this presented approach, we have shown that the performance of tree models improved by hyperparameter tuning when using design concepts data of TRS. Third, we performed sensitivity analysis to study the thermal variations on TRS and hence support robust design using tree models. Furthermore, the performance of tree models has been evaluated on mathematical linear and non-linear functions. The results of this study have shown that tree models fit well on non-linear functions. Last, we have shown how tree models support integration of value and sustainability parameters data (quantitative and qualitative data) together with TRS design concepts data in order to assess these parameters impact on the product life cycle in the early design phase.  },

  abstract  = {Cellular honeycomb cores with overlying flexible face sheets have been proposed for use as flex skins for morphing aircraft. The cellular cores, which provide underlying support to the face sheets for carrying aerodynamic loads, must have low in-plane stiffness and high in-plane strain capability. For one-dimensional morphing applications such as span-, chord-, or camber-change, restraining the Poisson?s contraction (or bulging) that a conventional cellular honeycomb core would otherwise experience in the non-morphing direction results in a substantial increase in the effective modulus in the morphing direction. To overcome this problem, this article develops zero Poisson?s ratio hybrid and accordion cellular honeycombs. Cellular Material Theory is extended, and analytical solutions for the mechanical properties and global strains of the hybrid and accordion cellular honeycombs are developed. The analytical results show excellent agreement with ANSYS finite element results. Comparing the properties shows that the hybrid and accordion honeycombs proposed have generally similar in-plane axial stiffness and strain capabilities to conventional honeycombs when the latter are unrestrained in the non-morphing direction. However, with the zero Poisson?s ratio of the hybrid and accordion honeycombs, it is observed that the axial stiffness in the morphing direction will not increase when the skins are restrained in the non-morphing direction. The zero Poisson?s ratio of the accordion and hybrid cellular honeycombs is not helpful from an out-of-plane load carrying ability standpoint. However, the out-of-plane load carrying ability of the accordion honeycombs can be superior to those of conventional honeycombs if the ?continuous fibers? are sufficiently thick, leading to a very large modulus in the non-morphing direction. The effective out-of-plane stiffness of hybrid cellular honeycombs, on the other hand, is poorer than conventional cellular honeycombs.},

The importance of testing of elastomers means that a comprehensive text on the subject is essential.

  abstract = {This paper identifies the desirable attributes of a flexible skin of a morphing wing. The study is conducted using airfoil camber morphing as an example. The ideal flex-skin would be highly anisotropic, having a low in-plane axial stiffness but a high out-of-plane flexural stiffness. Reduced skin axial stiffness allows morphing at low actuation cost. However, for some substructure and actuation designs, a lower limit on the skin's in-plane axial stiffness may be required to prevent unacceptable global camber deformation under aerodynamic loads. High flexural stiffness prevents local deformation of skin sections between supports due to aerodynamic pressure loads, and avoids buckling of skin sections under compression as the airfoil cambers under actuation force. For the camber morphing application the strain levels in the flex-skin are not expected to exceed around 2{\%}. If the axial stiffness of the flex-skin is reduced significantly, it may be necessary to consider aerodynamic stiffness (negligible vis - vis structural stiffness for classical airfoils) to accurately calculate deformation under loading. The approach followed in the study can be used to identify specifications for the skin and then reverse engineer and design highly anisotropic composite skins that meet the specifications. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract      = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Our study is the first to identify and analyse in detail the motion principle of Aldrovanda, which not only leads to a deepened understanding of fast plant movements in general, but also contributes to the question of how snap-traps may have evolved and also allows for the development of novel biomimetic compliant mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The push to advance efficient, renewable, and clean energy sources has brought with it an effort to generate materials that are capable of storing hydrogen. Metal-org. framework materials (MOFs) have been the focus of many such studies as they are categorized for their large internal surface areas. We have addressed one of the major shortcomings of MOFs (their processibility) by creating and 3D printing a composite of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and MOF-5, a prototypical MOF, which is often used to benchmark H2 uptake capacity of other MOFs. The ABS-MOF-5 composites can be printed at MOF-5 compns. of 10{\%} and below. Other phys. and mech. properties of the polymer (glass transition temp., stress and strain at the breaking point, and Young's modulus) either remain unchanged or show some degree of hardening due to the interaction between the polymer and the MOF. We do observe some MOF-5 degrdn. through the blending process, likely due to the ambient humidity through the purifn. and solvent casting steps. Even with this degrdn., the MOF still retains some of its ability to uptake H2, seen in the ability of the composite to uptake more H2 than the pure polymer. The expts. and results described here represent a significant first step toward 3D printing MOF-5-based materials for H2 storage. [on SciFinder(R)]},

  abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for hydrogen storage have continued to receive intense interest over the past decade. MOFs are a class of organic-inorganic hybrid crystalline materials consisting of metallic moieties that are linked by strong coordination bonds to organic ligands. They exhibit a great structural diversity and possess low weight, exceptionally high surface areas, large free volumes, and tunable pore sizes and functionalities, making them extremely attractive for a variety of applications such as hydrogen storage. For these reasons MOFs have been extensively studied. In this paper, a review of recent developments on hydrogen storage in MOFs is presented, with a focus on the effects of various factors including open metal sites, 'guest' metal ions, ligand functionalization, surface area, pore volume, pore size, and Pt or Pd metal nanoparticles, on hydrogen storage. In addition, the review examines the emerging research on MOF hybrid hydrogen storage systems, primarily in the context of employing MOFs for nanoconfinement of high temperature hydrogen storage materials. The review focuses on experimental studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The obstacles of large scale HAWT are elaborated, and the reasons of why Darrieus VAWT is key to the challenges are also explained.

  year     = {2018},
  month    = jan,
  abstract = {The main objective of this thesis is to develop a method to investigate stability behaviours of stiffened and unstiffened panels under the influence of in-plane compression and out-ofplane lateral pressure using appropriate simplifications. A test fixture to conduct buckling experiments with lateral pressure is also designed. Due to the deflection caused by the lateral pressure, considerable complexities will be introduced in terms of loading interactions and geometric nonlinearities, which make the analysis both theoretically difficult and computationally intensive. In addition, in aerospace structures, non-cylindrical wing and fuselage panels are potentially exposed to the combined action of in-plane compression and out-ofplane pressure, and the assessment of their stability behaviours becomes an issue of growing concern of structural engineers. To this end, the study of the buckling behaviour of stiffened panels under compression and lateral pressure is of practical importance. Step by step investigations are performed on typical structures from unstiffened isotropic plates to stiffened composite panels using both analytical and finite element approaches. First, linear based methods using equilibrium and energy equations based on classical plate theories are reviewed, and predictions indicate that these methods only validate within the range of small deformation under small pressure loading. Eigenvalue buckling analysis and explicit dynamic procedures are adopted as numerical methods for verification. Simulated results of explicit dynamic procedures in Abaqus predicted the buckling loads fairly well compared with those in literature, revealing that lateral pressure has a positive impact on the stability behaviour of rectangular isotropic plates by postponing the buckling onset. Composite panels behave similarly as isotropic plates in terms of buckling and postbuckling responses. Given a large pressure, the critical buckling load of a simply supported laminate is able to reach up to four times as that of the uniaxially compressed plate. A conceptual design of a test fixture for buckling experimental studies involving compression and lateral pressure is proposed in which pressurized airbags are adopted for generating uniform pressure load. The lateral loads are controlled by the internal pressure of airbags through a pressure gauge. Compression sensors are utilized to calibrate the pressure loads by measuring the reaction forces. A rubber filler pad is laid inside the panel’s bays between stringers to eliminate the unevenness on the stiffener side of the panel. Test rigs are designed with the consideration of compatibility with classical buckling experiments to lower the cost. Dynamic explicit simulations of the test reveal that the locations of the first local buckling onsets are shifted from the skin to stiffeners with the increase of lateral pressure. Buckling strengths of the entire stiffened panels exhibit an increase with the increase of lateral pressure. However, this trend is reversed when the pressure load exceeded a certain value at which stiffeners buckle before the skin.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, the transverse loading of sandwich plate is formulated to study the three-dimensional stress field in the sandwich plates for various edge conditions. The formulation is based on the weak formulation approach. A complete three-dimensional displacement field is considered and the weak formulation approach is employed to obtain the governing equations of the plate using the three dimensional equilibrium equations of elasticity. An analytical solution is presented for governing equations when two opposite edges of plate are simply supported. A one-step stress recovery scheme is used to compute the out-of-plane stresses in the sandwich plates. A comparison is made with the predictions of exact elasticity solutions in the open literature and very good agreements are achieved. The distribution of stresses is investigated for various boundary conditions and the log-linear procedure is employed to study the order of stress singularity at free and clamped edge of the plate. It is seen that the present approach accurately predicts the distribution of out-of-plane stresses and local concentration of stresses in the vicinity of free and clamped edges of sandwich structures.},

A number of elastomers, composite arrangements, and substructure configurations were evaluated and systematic characterization testing led to the selection of the most appropriate components for prototype development. The complete prototype morphing skin demonstrated 100{\%} uniaxial extension accompanied by a 100{\%} increase in surface area.

  abstract = {The wrapped tow reinforced (WrapToR) truss combines the benefits of a truss geometry with the impressive material properties of composites to produce highly efficient structural members. While composite trusses are not a new concept, this work uses a novel manufacturing process to produce a unique wound truss configuration. Adapted from filament winding, the manufacturing process involves wrapping wetted fibre tow around rigid longitudinal members to form a truss geometry. This manufacturing method dramatically reduces labour demands compared with traditional trusses, which require assembling a large number of parts. The WrapToR truss concept therefore offers a low-cost method for producing structural members that could offer significant weight savings in a range of applications. To progress towards commercial application, the current work focuses on further developing and understanding the novel truss concept. The research is divided into two main themes: manufacturing and analysis. The manufacturing work focused on developing and understanding the novel truss winding process. Prior to this work, WrapToR trusses were produced using a manual hand-winding process that is both inaccurate and labour-intensive. A key objective was to automate the process to improve consistency and throughput. This objective was achieved through the design and manufacture of a three-axis truss winding machine. Additional process development work found that twisting the shear member tow while winding significantly improved load-carrying capability. The analysis work focused on developing tools that could predict truss behaviour under static loading scenarios. Models based on matrix structural analysis techniques were built and experimentally validated using a series of three-point bending tests. Initially, the models' ability to predict pre-failure response was investigated. This preliminary investigation revealed the necessity of modelling behaviour at the truss joints to capture overall truss deformations. Failure analysis was later conducted in which the key truss failure mechanisms were identified and predicted. The mechanisms investigated were member material failure, joint failure, and local and global buckling. The critical loading of these mechanisms was predicted by implementing failure criterion within the developed truss model. Again, the predictive capabilities were validated via a series of three-point bend tests. An efficient design method was later developed that maximised truss structural efficiency by embedding the analysis tools within an optimisation algorithm. Results of this optimisation study showed huge weight-saving potential of the truss technology. Compared to conventional carbon fibre tubes, one truss configuration displayed over 50% mass reduction while offering equivalent strength and stiffness performance. Through development of the manufacturing process and exploration of modelling techniques, this work has significantly advanced understanding of the WrapToR truss technology. Combined with the demonstration of structural performance, the work lays the foundations for implementing the technology within commercial applications.},

  abstract  = {Metamaterials exhibit properties beyond those exhibited by conventional materials in conventional scenarios. These have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally at length. In many cases the underpinning physical understanding of metamaterials has greatly preceded our ability to manufacture constituent structures. However, the development of additive manufacturing techniques gives new possibilities for the fabrication of complex metamaterial structures, many of which cannot be realised through conventional fabrication methods. The literature to date contains contributions from a diverse group of researchers from the physical sciences, mathematics, and manufacturing technology in the creation of metamaterials for electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical applications. It is proposed that additive manufacturing holds the key to realise the capabilities of this vibrant research community and permit the creation of new paradigms in fundamental structures but also exploitation through application. For this purpose, a literature review is presented which identifies key advances in metamaterials alongside additive manufacturing and proposes new opportunities for researchers to work together through intra/inter disciplinary research to realise structures which exhibit extraordinary behaviour(s). This review represents a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in the production of such metamaterials using additive manufacturing methods and highlights areas, which, based on trends observed in the literature, are worthy of further research and require a coordinated effort on behalf of the afore mentioned disciplines in order to advance the state-of-the-art.},

To answer this question, for finite element models of periodic structures of Mooney-type material with different structural geometry and subject to large strain deformations, we identify a nonlinear elastic modulus as the ratio between the mean effective stress and the mean effective strain in the solid cell walls, and show that this modulus increases when the thickness of the walls increases, as well as when the number of cells increases while the volume of solid material remains fixed. Since, under the specified conditions, this nonlinear elastic modulus increases also as the corresponding mean stress increases, either the mean modulus or the mean stress can be employed as indicator when the optimum wall thickness or number of cells is sought.},

A novel zero Poisson's ratio cellular structure with low in-plane moduli and great morphing capabilities for multiple in-plane morphing is proposed in this paper. Theoretical models of the elastic constants of the structure are established and verified by the finite element method. Results show that the equivalent moduli of the structure are several orders of magnitude lower and the maximum global strains are considerably larger than those of the raw material. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties possess large changing ranges under the variations of parameters. Comparisons between the proposed structure and two existing ones indicated that the proposed structure possesses better performance and larger range of material selection for in-plane tensile morphing, while with some drawbacks for the in-plane shear morphing. The proposed structure shows great potential as core for flexible skin or flexible structure for multiple in-plane morphing applications.},

  abstract  = {Cellular honeycomb cores with overlying flexible skins have been proposed for use as deformable structures for morphing aircraft. Airfoils with a variable camber trailing edge require the camber to be changed continuously, which is pursued by the reconfiguration of both the underlying structures and the flexible skins. The honeycomb cores, which provide underlying support to the flexible skins for bearing the out-of-plane aerodynamic loads, must have low in-plane stiffness and high out-of-plane bearing capability. In this paper, a kind of cross-shaped honeycomb is designed and manufactured. Analytical, numerical, and experimental studies for the in-plane effective moduli of the cross-shaped honeycomb are carried out. The results demonstrate that the cross-shaped honeycomb has substantial in-plane deformability. A conceptual design of the variable camber trailing edge based on the crossshaped honeycomb is proposed and modeled using MSC.NASTRAN software. Simulation results show that the cross-shaped honeycomb can provide substantial in-plane deformation and adequate out-of-plane support, satisfying the deformability and bearing capacity requirements of the variable camber trailing edge.},

  abstract  = {Fish Cells as a new metamaterial with zero Poisson's ratio in two planar directions is introduced with application in morphing aircraft skin. In order to tailor the design of this metamaterial for arbitrary loadings, equivalent elastic properties of the Fish Cells metamaterial are derived and analyzed using analytical and numerical methods. The admissible range of geometric parameters is presented and variation of elastic properties with parameters is studied. The effective elastic modulus of the metamaterial is derived analytically and verified with finite element models. The in-plane and transverse shear modulus of the metamaterial are evaluated using finite element analysis where accurate periodic boundary conditions for in-plane shear loading are investigated. The lower and upper bounds of the transverse shear modulus are derived based on strain and complementary energy relations which are verified with finite element results. As zero Poisson's ratio behavior of the Fish Cells topology is proved, derivative geometries from this topology with zero Poisson's ratio behavior are also presented.},

  title    = {Manufacturing and characterisation of a composite FishBAC morphing wind tunnel model},
  year     = {2018},
  abstract = {Compliance-based camber morphing is a promising alternative to conventional aircraft control surfaces, such as rigid trailing edge plain flaps, which vary aerofoil camber in a sharp, sudden and discontinuous way. Unlike traditional trailing edge flaps, camber morphing based on compliant structural design achieves smooth and continuous changes in camber which have been shown to provide a similar lift control authority with significantly reduced drag penalty. One promising camber morphing concept is the Fish Bone Active Camber (FishBAC) device, which is currently being investigated for application to fixed and rotary wing vehicles. In order to extend the understanding of the aerodynamic behavior of this device and also to improve its structural behaviour, a wind tunnel model of a composite FishBAC equipped NACA 23012 wing section has been built. This paper will describe the manufacture of this morphing wing section, and present experimental characterisation of its actuators, the materials and the structural response under actuation loads. Finally, an initial design study is performed to investigate the useful ability of the FishBAC to create spanwise variations in camber, to control spanwise lift distribution and to modify three-dimensional wing stall.},

Adaptive skins are an essential component of morphing wings, which enable perimeter length changes with low deformation energy requirements and increase the efficiency of the morphing system. Based on fundamental considerations for morphing skins, a high shear to morphing stiffness ratio is targeted. The underlying deformation energies for compliant structures are evaluated and provide the basis for the developed geometry of the novel structure. The sizing parameters of the structure are optimized for shear stiffness and morphing stiffness by an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. A representative geometry is manufactured and tested to verify the nonlinear simulations for shear and morphing stiffness. Furthermore, various cover options forming the aerodynamic surface were investigated and compared in terms of out-of-plane deformations and for their interaction with the underlying structure. The chosen concept, comprising of the novel substructure and sliding covers, exhibits superior performance, reaching a shear to morphing stiffness ratio up to 300, while forming a closed aerodynamic surface.},

  year     = {2021},
  abstract = {Introduction: The term 3D printing is commonly used to depict an assembling method whereby the final form of an object is the result of the addition of different layers to build the frame of an object. This procedure is more accurately portrayed as additive manufacturing and is likewise alluded to as fast prototyping. The term 3D printing, in any case, is generally new and has been an active part of current developments in Dentistry. Much publicity encompasses the evolution of 3D printing, which is hailed as an innovation that will perpetually change CAM manufacturing, including in the dental sector. This review is the first part in a 3D Printing series that looks at the history of 3D Printing, the technologies available and reviews the literature relating to the accuracy of these technologies. Conclusions: The recent advancement in digital dentistry to incorporate these tools has modernised dental practices by paving the way for computer-aided design (CAD) technology and rapid prototyping. The use of 3D printing has led to 3D digital models produced with intraoral scanners (IOS), which can be manipulated easily for diagnosis, treatment planning, mockups, and a multitude of other uses. Combining 3D Printing with a 3D intraoral scan eliminates the need for physical storage but makes it to retrieve a 3D models for use within all dental modalities.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the Shape Adaptive Blades for Rotorcraft Efficiency (SABRE) Horizon 2020 research program and presents initial comprehensive analysis results on the efficacy of adapting blade shapes as a means of reducing rotorcraft power requirements and emissions. The aims of the research program are introduced, followed by discussion of the six different morphing concepts that will be explored. The morphing mechanisms are based on active camber, chord extension, twist, and active tendon morphing technologies. SABRE will explore the use of these concepts individually and in combination, for rotor quasi-steady configuration-type morphing and up to 2/rev actuation of some of the mechanisms, with the objective being to find the best balance between emissions reductions versus complexity
and added weight. Initial investigations into the potential power reductions compared to the baseline full-scale BO- 105 main rotor achievable with the morphing concepts were performed using Blade Element Momentum Theory and a comprehensive analysis model that was developed using CAMRAD II. The analytical model was validated by full- scale rotor wind tunnel measurements. A combination of active twist and active chord extension achieved up to 11% performance gain in hover. Active camber morphing performance was very sensitive to the combination of deflection, morphing section radial length and placement on the blade, as well as the actuation phasing and blade loading coefficient. The active camber morphing showed power reductions of up to 5.5% in hover and 5% at an advance ratio of 0.313 with a 2/rev actuation, while the active tendon concept showed the capability to change the dynamic response of the rotor blade.},

other software.
The purpose of this document is to give a brief explanation of the kind of tetrahedralizations and meshing problems handled by TetGen and to give fairly detailed documentation about the usage of the program. Readers will learn how to create tetrahedral meshes using
input files from the command line. Furthermore, the programming interface for calling TetGen from other programs is explained.},
